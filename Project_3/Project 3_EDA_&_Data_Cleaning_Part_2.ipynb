It goes as follows:\\n\\nIn another reality Loki was born female, which makes her a variant in the TVA’s eyes, so the TVA attempt to prune the branched timeline and take the baby, but are for some reason unsuccessful and the branch extends beyond the redline at which point they are unable to prune it. Then years later after learning of the TVA’s attack on her life and their attempt to destroy her reality she finds a way to strike back in order to prevent the TVA from destroying any more branched realities and harming other variants for things that are out of their control, like being born female.\\n\\nI’m probably completely wrong and I’m sure whatever Marvel does will be better but I thought this could be an interesting way of bringing in Lady Loki and giving both sides of the conflict motivations that are understandable.

But, I could see this happening one of two ways well actually three ways sort of and they all have some comic ties. The first one and I think lamest one is that they just travel to a point in Asgard before Odin put the worthy enchantment on it and you just see Loki hold, but that does nothing for me. The other way is Loki meets a variant of himself where instead of being the God of Mischief he becomes the God of heroism this has precedent in the comics either he meets him and he's wielding mjolnir, but we don't stop their at this point in the series I'd want this to be later on. So not only do we have a Loki variant holding mjolnir, but at some point in this episode our Loki similar to Steve in Endgame maybe he's facing off against our villain Loki and then boom he sees mjolnir in a desperate attempt goes for it and picks it up. So yeah doesn't have to happen I think it be cool tho.\",\n",

       "       'I believe that despite what the TVA says about how they see all, they are still in a separate reality from what I call the \"Infinity Saga\" timeline, **abbrievated I.S.T.** or Sacred Timeline for today\\'s post. (IMPORTANT NOTE: **The Sacred Timeline** ***is*** **the Infinity Saga).**\\n\\nHere\\'s why I think this:\\n\\n* Loki branched off into another reality and the TVA is something that happened to him *in that reality.* I don\\'t believe that the TVA took Loki back to the Sacred Timeline, they just took him to a place within the Loki reality. As far as I can tell, the TVA exists out of time anyway because they are in a reality bubble, much like Wanda putting Westview in that kind of bubble. Same kind of bubble, but of course Wanda\\'s not doing it this time. I think some other shadowy Phase 4 villain is.\\n* I still think the TVA and Loki are in a separate reality because we only found out the TVA existed *as we follow Loki after he branched off.* They either don\\'t exist in the IST/\"Sacred Timeline\" or, like the Eternals, don\\'t interfere with the Sacred Timeline.\\n* However, since the show says the TVA does see the Sacred Timeline (Infinity Saga), it says they didn\\'t interfere because it was supposed to happen. They\\'re not, strictly speaking, *a part of the Infinity Saga timeline.* They just saw it happen. They, and Loki being in the TVA, are not part of it. However they clearly have the authority to apprehend variants from it. **Or they think they do because someone gave them that power. Question is, who?**\\n* I believe that the TVA itself is in fact an illusion even though they say they aren\\'t.  ESPECIALLY after WandaVision, I would not be surprised. Even though they say it\\'s not, and Loki can\\'t use his magic, I still believe it is. **Why? Because Casey doesn\\'t know what a fish is. He \"spent his whole life behind a desk.\" It sounds like he** ***literally did, though. Literally.*** **He was born to work at the TVA, created only to do that, not to be a human man.**  In real life, people using that expression grew up in the world and would know what fish are. **I believe that the TVA and everyone in it was magically created, born as staff, and their sole purpose is to work at the TVA and hunt Variants. They were created to do it, like robots. The TVA has to be an illusion, or someone\\'s army only disguised as humans, whether or not they admit it.**\\n* Another reason why I think the TVA is an illusion is because I can\\'t figure out the answer to **this question: Why don\\'t they consider** ***their own timeline*** **to be the Sacred Timeline? Because I think Casey, if not anyone else,  knows they don\\'t** ***actually exist.*** Think of timelines like lives: Everyone has one. A person\\'s life is sacred to them, and whatever happens in a person\\'s life is their own \"sacred timeline\". But the TVA don\\'t call their own timeline/lives \"The Sacred Timeline,\" making me think that their \"lives\\' have no value to them, because in that reality,  **they are not actually alive or even fully human.** They were created, they\\'re fake people. If they were real, they would definitely call *their own timeline* \"The Sacred Timeline.\" **But they don\\'t.** But I will say that maybe the reason why the Infinity Saga is the sacred timeline is because it was the reality with the power to affect all other realities within the multiverse. But that doesn\\'t change my theory though. \\n* If Loki finds a way to get out of the TVA or go \"beyond it\", I\\'m sure it would be an illusion.  I think the TVA is some sort of Wanda-esque magical bubble. I think, whatever Mobius and the guards say, the TVA is in fact an illusion or in a reality bubble within whatever reality Loki branched off to from Endgame.',\n",

My wife hasn't watched any of the MCU movies.  Doesn't consider herself a superhero fan.

Started it all.  RDJ is dashing.  There's plenty of really funny humor.  An origin story.  In fact, the origin story for the whole Avengers Initiative.\\n\\n* The Avengers.

Sure, there's lots of references to Asgard's history, but I still think it would work well as a stand-alone movie for someone who hadn't seen the previous Thor movies.  And it ends with &gt;!Asgard being wiped out and the Asgardians heading out on their space ship!&lt; ... leading straight into Infinity War.\\n\\n(Meanwhile, I love all of the Captain America movies by themselves, but I don't think they're hugely important for IW/EG.)\\n\\nWhat would be your list?\",\n",
       "       'In case you’ve forgotten, Kaecilius is the villain of Dr Strange played by Mads Mikkelsen\\n\\nI think the primary argument against Kaecilius is that he doesn’t have much depth or pathos like the great villains like Thanos, Killmonger and co. But I think this isn’t necessarily a bad thing in his role as the villain of this movie.\\n\\nHis role as villain isn’t the same as him being a 3 dimensional character. The villain is mainly supposed to serve a specific thematic role for the narrative above them being sympathetic or emotionally deep or anything like that. And one of the main themes of Dr Strange is that Steven Strange is NOT the center of the universe. Strange is so self-centered at the beginning that he must be literally shown the vastness of existence across time and space to even begin his character arc of realizing he isn’t that important. That scene which would humble anyone in real life is just the start of strange maybe becoming humble 1 hour later into the movie. That’s how self centered he was.\\n\\nAnd so it’s imperative for the narrative that Strange isn’t the actual cause of the conflict or even the escalation of the conflict. Kaecilius begins the movie hating the Ancient One while the ancient one feels regret and shame over Kaecilius and Strange does nothing to affect this relationship. Typically, you would expect either kaecilius or the ancient one to be the MC since the drama is mainly around them. The student master betrayal. The secret of the dark dimension only matter to them specifically. And yet Strange is the MC.\\n\\nAnother self centered MC is Tony stark but his lesson wasn’t to learn to not be self centered so the story still made itself about him in every way. The villain is his jealous uncle. The conflict around weapon technology is entirely of his creation. Which is a stark contrast to Strange. In fact Strange is the ONLY Marvel MC who is this detached from the actual drama and stakes of the movie, so that it is clear that he is simply a small part of this greater universe.\\n\\nDr Strange has to learn to be a servant for mankind basically. Risking eternity fighting Dormammu for others. And the story reflects how much of a sacrifice this is by not giving him personal stakes in this.  He simply has to choose to do the right thing for others because he is to become a servant for everyone else.\\n\\nBecause of this deliberate choice, Kaecilius isn’t a deep character since we are seeing everything from Strange’s outsider POV. This is the equivalent of Darth Vader fighting Obi Wan while Luke watches on. We have no idea the true depth of emotions between those other people fighting and we are even more detached than Luke because at least then Obi Wan knew Luke personally way more than the ancient one knew Strange and Darth Vader had killed Luke’s father (from a certain point of view) while Kaecilius had no personal anything with Strange.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I think a bit too much weight is put on “depth in villains” when sometimes a bad guy is just supposed to be a bad guy. Kind of like Mysterio in Far from Home. And people see Kaecilius as a failure of a villain because the very nature of Dr Strange as a story is supposed to have him much less involved with Strange than any other marvel movie. To the point that the actual end is Strange defeating Dormammu instead of Kaecilius since there wasn’t anything built up between them, VERY INTENTIONALLY SO.',\n",

       "       'So this is what I call a deepwatch. In a deepwatch, I like to think about the episode in terms of inner motivations and previously established ideas, analyse as much as I can in a scene, and comment on how everything comes together. (I\\'ve done this before for _The Umbrella Academy_ season 1, which you can find a link to [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/UmbrellaAcademy/comments/gi7bo6/spoilers_for_all_s01_indepth_breakdown_and/) if you\\'re interested.)\\n\\nThis is gonna be a long bloody post, be prepared for some deep fucking analysis. Goes without saying that **you should not be here if you haven\\'t watched the episode**, cause this will totally and utterly spoil basically everything in it, but I\\'ll say it anyway. Movie spoilers too, especially for the movies Loki has been in previously. If you have any feedback, please leave a comment! I want to start a discussion, that\\'s how we come up with more ideas. I tentatively plan to do this for each episode, and I will update each post as new episodes shed light on the happenings in previous ones, because that\\'s always interesting to think about too - helps us extrapolate as to what might end up happening later on.\\n\\nIn addition, I have not read the comics, please point out anything I might have missed in this regard.\\n\\n------------\\n\\n**S01E01** - *Glorious Purpose*\\n\\n- The title is part of 2012 Loki\\'s catchphrase. He discovers the immense irony of this over the course of the episode. I can\\'t say at this point if he has found a new \"glorious purpose\" by the time the end credits roll, but his old one is shattered into about a billion pieces.\\n\\n- Some extra reaction shots have been added to the *Endgame* footage that begins the show, emphasizing Loki\\'s reactions to the event, and how this is now Loki\\'s point of view. (This makes this scene also different from the first _Loki_ trailer\\'s version of the _Endgame_ scene.) This also sets up for the later reveal that Loki deduces that the Avengers are meddling with time. The new shots I can see are the close up on Capt. America!Loki, the close-up on Loki waving to Hulk in the elevator, and a dramatic look-backwards when Loki sees Endgame!Tony grabbing the Tesseract and making a beeline for the stairs.\\n\\n- I note the score in this scene is also different from _Endgame_ - although it uses the main Avengers motif, it has more ticking, mystery and ominous-ness around it. _Endgame_\\'s version is lighter and played more for laughs, in an \"everything\\'s going wrong, haha\" sort of way. \\n\\n- Interestingly, there are now three instances of this event in the MCU - the original in _The Avengers_ (which does not explore what happened immediately after Loki asked for a drink - so there was no snarky illusory play, or Hulk-taking-the-stairs issues, or any confrontation in the lobby, whether from Pierce or time-travelling doppelgangers - seen in that movie), the failed Tesseract retrieval seen in _Endgame_, from Tony, Steve and Scott\\'s POV, and now from Loki\\'s POV in _Loki_. I wonder if the \\'wave\\' was reshot not only for emphasis of Loki\\'s POV, but also because ultimately a variant of Loki must always escape to be recruited by the TVA, and his little sarcastic wave contributes to Hulk\\'s anger and frustration when opening the ground floor stair door, which ends up manoeuvring the Tesseract back into Loki\\'s hands.\\n\\n- Maybe more of an _Endgame_ commentary, but the wave\\'s timing is very much in character for Loki. He sees that both Thor and Tony will not let Hulk in, and only waves when he sees the elevator doors closing. In the Endgame footage, we focus on Hulk, seeing him punch the elevator doors and walk over to the stairs, but in this episode, we stay with Loki waving in the lift and only *hear* the Hulk\\'s punch.\\n\\n- Hiddleston seems to have some (appropriate) trickster eyes, just off this one episode - sometimes they\\'re a shocking blue and other times they\\'re a soft hazel or a muted green. No idea if this is CGI or if casting is basically Watcher-level lmao. I notice in this Endgame scene, his eyes are mostly green.\\n\\n- Hiddleston seems to have grown out and dyed his hair for the series, something I don\\'t think he has done since 2011 and the first *Thor* - he\\'s been making use of wigs in the other movies. Maybe it\\'s easier makeup wise, less time especially being on set every day as the focal point of the show. Unfortunately his real hair is thinning at the temples and is also slightly shorter in length than 2012 Loki\\'s hair. You can see the difference between the *Endgame* footage, and the extra shots added in by this show, not to mention the Gobi Desert scene. His hair barely goes past his shoulders in the new scenes, whereas it does in the Endgame footage. The wave in the elevator has Loki with ever-so-slightly different hair (shorter in length and retreating hairline, sorry mate), so my conclusion was that this was filmed with the Loki series, whereas I believe the other two shots are simply extra unused Endgame takes. Perhaps he should have used extensions, at least until the scene of him getting his TVA jumpsuit. Could have probably hand-waved a haircut there (maybe even a goddamn wash! Dude\\'s mane was looking pretty bloody greasy in _Avengers_) and it\\'d\\'ve made a nice allusion to Thor getting his hair cut short in *Ragnarok*.\\n\\n- The first _Loki_ trailer containing the _Endgame_ footage suggested a Bifrost-like journey through space before landing in the desert ([here](https://youtu.be/PlpjPCssEXE?t=26))  - was this to make us think that Loki was no longer on earth at that point? I think so, and I also think that this Bifrost journey is another tiny snippet from a future _Loki_ episode, used in the wrong place as trailers often do. I reckon we\\'ll do that trip again, but in proper narrative order.\\n\\n- Alright, the episode here cuts into the Marvel Studios intro sequence. It\\'s different from the last two Disney+ shows - for one, the score is a new composition, unique to _Loki_ - slow, deep and  mysterious, almost sad, using theremin heavily, a little synth - whereas _WV_ and _FATWS_ used the usual intro score. In addition, the intro sequence here is _after_ the 2012 scene, whereas the premieres of _WV_ and _FATWS_ had the Marvel Studios intro sequence before showing anything else. Intro length and images used in the sequence appear consistent, but the end logo ends up tinted Loki green and gold. (Fuck yeah. I was so bloody excited seeing this for the first time. I think the only time they\\'ve adjusted the logo colour like this was for Black Panther.)\\n\\n- cut to some sand and the reflection of a weird CGI black bug with yellow spots in a water droplet. I have no idea what this means. Why would you even add this into a scene? I wonder if it\\'s a reference to a later development?\\n\\n- And we open to a little blue dot streaking across the desert sky and cannonning into the sand. Goddamn, why is he in the sky? Can\\'t Loki control where he goes with the Tesseract? Perhaps he wasn\\'t thinking far enough ahead to decide on a destination. Just somewhere as far away as possible from the Avengers lol, in which case he\\'s lucky he didn\\'t land in the Indian Ocean, New York\\'s antipode! He also can\\'t very well go home to Asgard, or to somewhere in space Thanos\\' court can\\'t find him at this point. So, somewhere far away on Earth, where he can hopefully pick up the pieces and rework his plans for global domination, lol.\\n\\n- Loki lands in the Gobi desert, bits of shackle everywhere (too much debris? those shackles weren\\'t that big, and he\\'s not wearing any other restraints besides the asgardian cuffs and the metal gag). Reminds me of Iron Man crashing in the desert. Is this scene then promising a similar warmongering-asshole-to-hero plot?\\n\\n- Very much in character for this Loki to leap onto a nearby rock, putting him above everyone else in the scene, and begin trying to conquer the resident population. The confidence-in-strength and magnified resentment the sceptre gives him is gone, however, and he is still smarting from being trounced by those he thought were merely ants. The word from Marvel is that Loki was affected in some way by the sceptre, as was Hawkeye, and the solution to the mind control as seen in _Avengers_, was to get clocked in the head. Getting Hulk smashed, ragdoll style, has to qualify for that. He\\'s far more jokey and unsure after getting metronome-mashed and having his angry-stick taken away from him. (Please note that this does not excuse his invasion of Earth or his shitty actions in _Thor_.) In addition, Loki in _Ragnarok_ was able to access others\\' memories without the Mind Stone, which could be implied to be an existing ability, as he knows Black Widow\\'s history - regardless, the powers from the Mind Stone kinda seen like a known, familiar quality to him, and fit well with his existing power set and talents. But the sceptre and its stone are back in New York, and he can\\'t use them as both a crutch and a protection mechanism anymore; and it shows. This is the second crack in his carefully developed defences, the first being the actual loss to the Avengers. Those defences are gonna be pretty FUBAR\\'d by the time the credits roll.\\n\\n- Jumping onto that rock has another advantageous effect - it\\'s kinda obvious that they had to film Hiddleston for this scene separately from everyone else, and having the stand-in higher up means that you don\\'t see the back of their head when the other characters are in frame. Pulled me out of the scene a little, I must say. \\n\\n- Very cool and in character to have his first words in the series proper be his catchphrase. \"I am Loki, of Asgard, and I am burdened with glorious purpose.\" He starts off kind of tired, actually (you can hear it on the \"of Asgard\" -  a \\'here we go again\\' vibe). First signs that the facade could be slipping.\\n\\n- I wonder if the Mongolians can actually understand him? The scene seems to be played so one can take either impression.\\n\\n- Suddenly, he sees the TVA entry team, clocks that they\\'re more powerful than the natives and that they\\'re closer to the Tesseract than he is, and goes over to confront them. Interestingly, Loki doesn\\'t  take the Tesseract with him before trying to monologue at the natives, surely it\\'d be more threatening, and give him a bit of a confidence boost? Maybe we can chalk this up to still being kinda off after that landing.\\n\\n-  This 2012 Loki, fresh from his defeat at the hands of the Avengers, with his blustery little speeches being cut off, ignored, or derailed, reminds me of another unpredictable trickster, Captain Jack Sparrow - [*grandiose*] \"You will remember this as the day you almost-\" [*gets drenched by massive wave* / *gets knocked out* / *gets talked over* / etc.]\\n\\n- Introduction of Wunmi Mosaku as Hunter B-15. I wonder if she has an actual name, because that just sounds like a title, and we do meet other characters with normal names like Casey. (Mobius M. Mobius on the other hand is a weird fucking name, almost like a pseudonym. Hmmmm.) Anyway, B-15 seems methodical and no-nonsense and deals with Loki in like 15 seconds. (Avengers [binoculars]: write that down, write that down!)\\n\\n- Some nice bass synth as Hunter B-15 comes in. She doesn\\'t even look at Loki as she comes in, and you know instantly that he\\'s next to nothing in her eyes. (To her, not only is her organisation powerful far beyond anything in this universe, he\\'s not even the \\'real\\' Loki, just a copy.)\\n\\n- The helmets look very Kraut. They\\'re only missing the spike. Nod to the fascistic tendencies of the TVA?\\n\\n- These time cannon things look like futuristic truncheons. Reminds me of those big-ass sticks from _A Clockwork Orange_. Probably intentional. I note that the business end can be different colours, possibly indicating different effects. When B-15 uses the stick on Loki, it\\'s purple, and I see another guy in the background with an orange stick. Same as the colours of the reset charge, which makes a good deal of sense.\\n\\n- ooooooh. Getting hit with the time stick looks like it doesn\\'t half-sting, huh? If Loki had residual Mind Stone issues going on, then I\\'m gonna take a wild guess and say he certainly isn\\'t gonna have them now. The lip movements don\\'t look entirely correct for being smashed to the side like that, but whatcha gonna do? Hit him in the face with a stick for real? I don\\'t think anyone is that much of a method actor lol\\n\\n- We don\\'t see what a reset timeline looks like when the charge goes off (besides a slowly widening strangely-coloured circle under the charge), but by the way Loki\\'s eyes widen (he doesn\\'t even see the whole thing, just a glimpse), it might not be particularly fun. (There\\'s even a quick shot of some of the Mongolians, just to underscore that this charge will affect them too.) I assume what \\'resetting the timeline\\' involves will be a plot point later in the series. The charge itself looks like a two-chambered affair, and the plunger at the top disturbs the orange contents of one vial, breaking it, seemingly allowing two substances to mix into purple and have their effect.\\n\\n- Okay, we had three other TVA personnel with us in the previous scene but only B-15 reappears with Loki through the portal. Not sure where the other three fucked off to. Maybe they portalled straight to the locker rooms lmao. I guess they\\'re not responsible for processing Variants from the timeline, since B-15 has Loki in hand.\\n\\n- Also, just wanted to point out, this is one lady in armour, frogmarching the supervillain of _Avengers_ down a corridor with one hand while holding the Tesseract in the other. This is some Worf Effect shit.\\n\\n- Variant Skrull! They\\'ve got a collar too. Wonder what they did to impugn the Sacred Timeline. This one I swear I saw in _Captain Marvel_.\\n\\n- aha! We get another Variant character, apparently human this time, some snotty cashed-up twerp. This poor asshole is gonna be a painful example for Loki later on, but right now, he serves as an fall-guy introduction for the audience and a distraction for Loki to use to try and run away.\\n\\n- I like the set up of the little time twister control and collar. You get to see Loki trying to get away, and B-15 bringing him back by resetting his position in his personal timeline, which doesn\\'t affect his memory of what happened, similar to the time stick used earlier, and after the second attempt, you see him pulling at his collar, which connects the little remote B-15 is holding to the collar he\\'s wearing. I\\'m unsure as to the period of time that is controlled by the time twister (as in how far back you can reset someone\\'s personal timeline with it), but I foresee it being used to trick future antagonists, not just B-15 as happens later this episode, because of this thorough introduction.\\n\\n- At 5:41 here, in the close up on B-15, you can see a whole bunch of etched tally marks, maybe 60 or 70, on her helmet,  Timelines reset? Variants captured? Variants pruned? Kind of ominous. A nice detail that underlines that this ain\\'t her first rodeo.\\n\\n- I reckon her little \"oh, you\" face when Loki tries to run away is hilarious. \\n\\n- A little peeved Loki didn\\'t try to use illusions or magic right here, in the attempt to get away from B-15. Maybe he was saving it up for the right moment, thinking that the TVA didn\\'t know he could use magic, or maybe it was just plot-driven dumbassery.\\n\\n- Here\\'s Casey! So the TVA guy with the variant Skrull seemed to go through the full signing-in-a-Variant process, but B-15 just shoves Loki\\'s Tesseract at him and tells him to log that shit. Either indicative of B-15\\'s brusque personality, or perhaps a kind of general disrespect that field personnel have for the office guys. We\\'ll have to wait and see which.\\n\\n- lmao \"It\\'s the Tesseract. Be very careful with it.\" \"Sounds stupid.\" First sign that things are not what they seem, Casey picks up the Tesseract with bare hands (B-15 is wearing gloves). So far, no run-of-the-mill mortals have touched Infinity Stones with bare hands without consequence. The other thing is that these guys don\\'t seem to know anything about the Tesseract. We\\'ll come back to that later...\\n\\n- \"You cross me, there are deadly consequences.\" Delivery\\'s okay, but it\\'s slowly starting to feel like a part Loki is putting on, like Shakespeare in the park, and he\\'s becoming less convincing (and convincing himself less) each time.\\n\\n- by the way, set looks very orange 1960s-1970s retro futuristic bureaucracy, a real switch up from the previous shows and even previous movies. I\\'m getting like _Brazil_, _Blade Runner_ and _Men in Black_ vibes. Anyone played _Control_? That whole bureaucratic vibe (except that\\'s more like a 50\\'s vibe to me). It\\'s an awesome game, highly recommend. Also _We Happy Few_.\\n\\n- lmao _Loki_ set boss apparently said let\\'s just shove Hiddleston in a dressed-up lift for this bit. Cute\\n\\n- lmao Loki complaining about the machine scuffing his leather. Fighting new humiliation at every turn, slowly being stripped of all of his little stereotypes. I like that the machine looks worried for a second before pulling out the laser like \"oh maybe he will like this better?\"\\n\\n- lmao Loki stuttering in embarassment after getting his armour lasered off. Loki\\'s surprisingly ripped, a lot more muscly than he came across in prior films - he seemed small and lithe in _Thor_, for example. Anyway, cheers for the workout, Hiddleston 👍\\n\\n- It\\'s borderline weird seeing Loki in anything other than leather or Asgardian-style garb. He only dons other outfits when \\'undercover\\' in Midgard, and those outfits are invariably impeccably tailored and stylish. (You can see that even in this episode, via D. B. Cooper\\'s styling; a gorgeous dark blue three-piece, plus a little tiepin with some kind of green stone inset, which fit the historical Cooper\\'s description. Hiddleston\\'s hair is slicked back but seems shorter in this scene, I think - I\\'m wondering if they filmed that scene last, so his hair could be cut to show this as a different, earlier Loki?) Thor is the one who walks around with his guns out; Loki prefers long sleeves. (In *The Dark World*, when Prime Loki finds out his mum\\'s dead and has a breakdown, that\\'s the most casually dressed we ever see him, and he\\'s still wearing long sleeves and full-length leggings.) Before this, I couldn\\'t have imagined Loki in so much as a t-shirt. That\\'s all been turned upside-down. His leather armour is literally fucking vapourised and he gets shoved unceremoniously (and somewhat impossibly) into a utilitarian TVA-labelled, beige-coloured, short-sleeved jumpsuit and dinky Velcro sneakers between shots. This is the most skin Loki has ever displayed in the whole MCU - lends him even more of a sense of vulnerability and fish-out-of-waterness.\\n\\n- aww, cute surprised kitty! Possible flerken? Unsure. There\\'s an uneaten sandwich on the piles of paperwork in here.\\n\\n- lol, there\\'s like multiple levels of surprise on Loki\\'s face in this scene. First to find himself clothed, then the cat, then the TVA office guy. Loki\\'s starting to look like a lifer in prison in his jumpsuit, lol\\n\\n- Clock behind the TVA guy has multiple hands, just like the one that appears in the credits. If time doesn\\'t pass normally in the TVA, how do these clocks measure time? Also, it looks like the set team have taken a bunch of 24hr clocks and modified them - the usual 6-o\\'clock position is taken by the 12. I guess it makes sense to be in some kind of 24hr time, you can\\'t see outside in here, and from the wider TVA seen later on, I don\\'t see a sun or a moon or anything that could help with knowing the time of day.\\n\\n- I personally prefer the delivery of this \"sign for everything you have ever said\" moment from the trailer better. But I still like how Loki buttons his lip and grabs the pen so that he won\\'t have to wait for more printer paper to sign, lol. You can feel the \"wtf??\" and resigned frustration just coming off him in waves. When he stands back, dude looks like he\\'s contemplating every single one of the life choices that led to this wacky moment.\\n\\n- from the movement of the pen, he\\'s written his name in English, and with a lowercase L to start with. It\\'s almost like malicious compliance, the bare level of satisfaction lol. \"You want me to sign??? Alright, I\\'ll motherfucking sign!!!\" \\n\\n- This better be like newfangled multisided quantum TVA paper, where you can keep turning the paper over to see new information. Cause there is no way that this piddly little stack is _everything_ Loki has ever said in his life. Even Mobius talks about this in this very same episode.\\n\\n- Loki forgot the trap-door in the floor, and growls at it for a second. What\\'s even more hilarious is that there _are_ doors (and even queue ribbon things either side of the door!) in all of these rooms, just that he never gets the chance to use them except when he\\'s pushed into this weird-ass pseudo-assembly line.\\n\\n- and into the temporal aura thingo! Loki can feel some kind of energy (?) field, indicated by a buzzing noise to us, in the archway, so he doesn\\'t walk in straightaway.\\n\\n- Perfectly in character to worry about whether he\\'s a robot or not - it was only very recently that Loki found out he was adopted and not even the species he thought he was, in the grand scheme of things. Also, he can see weird silver-black gunk on the walls of the archway, in what looks like a blast pattern. That\\'d worry me too.\\n\\n- Finally Loki gets to use a door like a normal person, lol. The ticket machine says, \"Your Turn Automatically - Take a Tab\". Hundreds of ceiling lights wash the whole scene yellow, and there\\'s another of those weird-ass clocks in the back.\\n\\n- The back of the ticket sign says \"Warning! Processing Protocols. Proceed in an orderly fashion through the processing line. Speak only when spoken to by an authorised TVA agent. No Talking, No Fighting. Violators will be dealt with harshly. Miss Minutes welcomes you.\"\\n\\n- TVA guard purses his lips when Loki belligerently holds up his ticket. Lol, actor trying to keep a straight face?\\n\\n- Putting the ticket in his pocket sets up the idea of pockets in Loki\\'s jumpsuit, and things he could put in those pockets, without any need for magic. Very good.\\n\\n- \"Hey there, you\\'re probably saying, \\'This is a mistake, I shouldn\\'t even be here!\\'\" Could there be a chance Miss Minutes is omniscient lmao? Probably just a joke (she doesn\\'t get the exact wording of Loki\\'s outburst correct), but she is also on the series\\'s poster, and I don\\'t want to underestimate her. On the other hand, there\\'s a poster in the background that says \"Everything here watched and recorded\".\\n\\n- this little animation is top-notch. Reminds me of the Jetsons, Hanna Barbera stuff. Very cool, and very informative (although it pays to be aware that this is probably history as written by the victors). Scored very well, theremin comes back.\\n\\n- the little yellow character\\'s bowtie flops loose as he becomes a variant, and this little floppy undone tie dude is the same variant shown later who punches in late. All the versions of the character still have the same bow-tie somewhere on their person (all with eeeeevil furrowed eyebrows, lol) but have other distinguishing characteristics.\\n\\n- Mention of \\'multiverse\\' and \\'madness\\', both title words in the upcoming \"Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness\". Also, in order for Doctor Strange to be concerned about a Multiverse of Madness, doesn\\'t there need to *be* a multiverse in the first place? The TVA may not be as in control at the end of this series as they are at the beginning.\\n\\n- You can commit a crime against the Sacred Timeline by being late for fucking work. That\\'s stupid. The TVA don\\'t seem to be very good guys at this point in time, but I guess that\\'s how you make us cheer for someone who would otherwise be the villain in a piece - introduce something even more evil.\\n\\n- the animation says the workers at the TVA were \\'created\\' to serve the Time-Keepers, which Mobius doesn\\'t deny later. Maybe they were all variants at some point, it\\'s just that they don\\'t know it. Or they\\'re all types of robot, to add extra weirdness to that \"am I a robot?\" scene.\\n\\n- here\\'s that annoying fall-guy from before, meeting his horrible end at the business end of an _orange_ tipped time stick. Gets Loki to behave himself (bet you he was the paragon of politeness when he got to the processing window, all pleases and thankyous), was perhaps the fate of all those in Loki\\'s reset timeline (note the strange shimmery blue colour as that guy disappears, it\\'s similar to the colour and effect that spreads out from the charge in the reset timeline), establishes this feeling of being pruned as being unpleasant, if not outright painful, and tells us exactly what the orange end of the stick does. I wonder if we will see the Prime version (shut up Amazon) of this dude as a cameo in later movies or Disney series, he seems well-characterised and recognisable, if not particularly likeable at this point lol.\\n\\n- lol Loki frantically trying to find his ticket after the dude gets pruned. [Indy Jones reference](https://youtu.be/oRSQi97RRzk)! Fuck, I should rewatch those movies, they\\'re awesome.\\n\\n- \"Thanks for visiting the TVA, don\\'t hesitate to let us know how we\\'re doing!\" Is Miss Minutes saying that because the guy got pruned?? Fuck, that\\'s dark.\\n\\n- Ticket number above the processing window is 8365129. That could be how many got processed. Unfortunately that doesn\\'t count how many got pruned before reaching the window. Brr.\\n\\n- Twelve minutes in, we finally get the title card. Loki\\'s name, each letter changing font as the score\\'s clock theme ticks away. Slowly the letters stop changing; first the L, then the K, then the I, then finally the O, to match the promo logo. Shapeshifting, eat your heart out. This show is gonna be about identity. Who are you at your core? Can you change that? Anyway, looks fucking awesome, I love this logo far better than the luridly-coloured one on the promo material. Score is fucking A+, thank you Natalie Holt. Getting like Hans Zimmer _Inception_ vibes? Aaaah, I can\\'t think what this white on black, old-tape-style title card reminds me of. Hopefully someone else will read this and let me know...\\n\\n- And cut to Owen Wilson making his debut in the MCU! Wilson\\'s grey hair gives me Vincent-from-_Collateral_ vibes (an awesome movie I highly recommend); he looks like someone who has gone grey prematurely, especially with Wilson\\'s naturally round, boyish face. (Wilson\\'s 52 years old! He certainly doesn\\'t look it, neither does Mobius, his character, and that with the grey hair emphasizes the man-out-of-time look.) This role looks and feels very different from Wilson\\'s usual performances; there\\'s a serious, seen-it-all quality about his character, even though a sense of playfulness and optimism shines through in his interactions with other characters. Overall, he comes across as understanding, to the point of feeling like he\\'s channelling fucking Oogway from Kung Fu Panda lol.\\n\\n- So Mobius is investigating the massacre of a Minutemen team + their Hunter (team leader, sounds like). Once again, there\\'s four in the team as seen in the little TVA information cartoon, and when Loki got brought to the TVA. One Hunter, three Minutemen. Looks like they\\'re in a church in France in 1549. I note what looks like a St. Joan of Arc stained glass window - this is around a hundred years after her death, so it makes sense for that to be there. So what caused the nexus event that the Minutemen responded to?\\n\\n- Mobius\\' belt buckle is very big and silver. Wondering if it says TVA, but I can\\'t tell.\\n\\n- Hunters seem to have a designation that starts with a letter, stencilled in orange on their helmets. Minutemen have only a number, lengthy and stencilled in white, in smaller sized font. The Hunter escorting Mobius appears to be U-92, whereas Mobius seems like a detective of some kind, as opposed to U-92\\'s time-cop routine. Can\\'t tell if he\\'s also the type to put tally marks on his helmet like B-15.\\n\\n- U-92 says it\\'s the sixth attack in a week, and Wilson\\'s character adds, \\'that we know of\\'. The commonality so far seems to be that the TVA team is surprised, and dies to a man from stab wounds, the reset charge is stolen, and they think it\\'s a \\'he\\'. Hooded!Loki getting bloody busy. He would have at least six charges by now (we don\\'t know if there were attacks last week).\\n\\n- U-92 speaking better French than Mobius, lmao. Also confirmation the TVA guys speak everything.\\n\\n- I can\\'t believe this 1500s kid is reacting like this, he must be in shock or something. So he saw this killer that he associates with the devil, killer gave him lollies, then more weirdly dressed guys show up through some portal and present him with a stick-guy animation on some magic window thing. I would have hidden under a table or run away screaming. Why is the Devil on stained glass anyway? Is that a thing? (One Google later - it *is* a thing.)\\n\\n- Thought this kid was a girl at first. It\\'s the mediaeval hairstyle, perhaps. Softer features when you\\'re younger.\\n\\n- \"Don\\'t worry, that devil is scared of us. We\\'re gonna take care of him.\" (In English. For emphasis to the audience? Since the kid is supposed to be French and should not be able to understand this?) Is that devil (the Loki variant) actually scared of them? Is this something Mobius is saying to reassure himself?\\n\\n- obvious electric guitar riff when the kid hands over the anachronistic gum. Very out of place in 16th century France (both the guitar and the gum).\\n\\n- So the gum has to be scanned for changes in temporal aura. Sooo, when you travel through time, your aura changes? They wanted a photo of Loki from before... which would maybe show if he had been timeline-hopping before he encountered B-15? Just spitballing here. This Loki variant seems to know what they\\'re doing and U-92 doesn\\'t think they\\'ll find anything.\\n\\n- I get the feeling Mobius wants the variant kid to see the sun and be outside one last time before the timeline is reset. That\\'s pretty sad. Also very empathetic. Mobius is so bloody nice, holy moly. This guy better not turn out to be an evil dick. (Although, I\\'d love to see Wilson play an evil dick, that\\'d be fun to watch.)\\n\\n- sooo how bad is this Loki variant anyway? He didn\\'t kill the kid, gave him gum, and stopped the Minutemen wiping out his timeline (which could possibly be painful, as established in the processing scene with the dickhead fall-guy). Maybe he\\'s a vigilante, champion of variants, trying to bring about the multiverse. Right now, the TVA aren\\'t looking amazingly heroic.\\n\\n- Mobius gets handed a file on the Loki variant we\\'re following in this series. Looks like Loki is 6 foot 2, which Google tells me is Hiddleston\\'s actual height. Dude hasn\\'t been looking particularly 6 foot 2 until now (probably because he\\'s not standing next to bloody Thor anymore lmao).\\n\\n- cut back to the TVA. Loki\\'s guided into a courtroom (apparently Time Court 37 judging by the wall) by B-15. Courtroom itself looks like it got pulled out of Soviet Russia. Big almost religious looking propaganda murals (orange is the main colour, not red). Brutalist architecture. Even the gallery seats look like church pews. Two murals look at the Time Keepers and how they created the Sacred Timeline (chopping off timeline branches with a sword, lovely), the next mural shows the Minutemen and Hunters, the fourth the office staff, and the last one, the Judges. (Looks like Stan Lee\\'s some kind of Judge-adjacent figure, since his picture has a medal and not a Judge sash, which might go some way to explaining his appearances across the MCU.)\\n\\n- Here is Judge Renslayer\\'s (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) first appearance, although she does not introduce herself in the courtroom.\\n\\n- These numbers (\"sequence violation 7-20-89\") mean nothing to me. Do they refer to a date? Someone\\'s birthday? In the same vein, I wonder if this Loki\\'s variant number, L1130, means anything.\\n\\n- Goddamn, they\\'re calling this guy Laufeyson and he\\'s not turning a hair. Dude massacred the Jotun and killed his own father as a repudiation of his lineage, I\\'m thinking he should be touchy about the name they\\'re calling him. On the other hand, I reckon he\\'d be outright miffed if they called him Odinson at this point.\\n\\n- \"Madam, a god doesn\\'t plead.\" 10/10, perfect bloody characterisation of this Loki from this point in time. We already know it\\'s wrong, we\\'ve heard him whine after getting his clothes burnt off. This is the most put together and competent he\\'s sounded so far this episode. Perhaps he\\'s reassured by the the thought that he might still have his magic to fall back on.\\n\\n- \"I\\'d like to go home now.\" What, Asgard? Really? So he\\'s thinking he\\'d rather be there at this point, getting an Odinlecture, instead of here? I think he doesn\\'t _need_ to _see_ paperweight Infinity Stones to know he\\'s in over his head here, it\\'s just that he doesn\\'t want to admit it to himself.\\n\\n- and here we are, the reveal that Loki\\'s brain has been working on multiple fronts - he\\'s figured out that the Avengers have been meddling with time, but his massive ego won\\'t let him consider that there might be a worse power for the Avengers to fight off. Also, he looks even kinda proud here, the idea that the Avengers had to resort to fucking with the timeline to deal with him probably gives him a warm fuzzy feeling.\\n\\n- Mobius hurries in just after this and sits at the back with his file on Loki.\\n\\n- Loki apparently figured it out because Tony wears too much fucking Axe as per Ant-Man in _Endgame_. What the fuck lol. Dude has either a super nose or he\\'s just making fun of Tony, cause I\\'m pretty sure he saw Ant-Man push the briefcase back (which gives him super eyes... I dunno.)\\n\\n- Loki asking for a team to find the Avengers and bring them back reminds me of Prime Loki\\'s deal with Thanos for the Space Stone, and then the \"pledge undying loyalty before backstabbing\" plot he tried in _Infinity War_. I wonder if the \"team\" request helped Mobius\\' decision to try and recruit this Loki.\\n\\n- B-15 doesn\\'t like being referred to as \"resources\" lmao\\n\\n- Lmao, he winks at the Judge on \\'gods to gods\\'. Is this the Loki equivalent of complaining to the manager?\\n\\n- I note a few extra people in the courtroom beside Mobius. \"Hey, did you hear? A Loki variant\\'s being trialled today.\" \"You mean like that one out there killing our guys? Fuck me, I gotta see this...\"\\n\\n- \"Guilty... of this.\" Score swells ominously, oh shit...\\n\\n- ...aaaand nada, lol. It seems like he\\'s trying to create a telekinetic blast like Loki Prime did back on Asgard in _The Dark World_. Look, I\\'m not sure how magic works in this universe, but my first thought was, how does such a perceived strong magic user not know internally that his magic is unavailable in this dimension? Perhaps it\\'s like the Infinity Stones - they look exactly the same and glow and everything, but don\\'t work at all at the TVA. So Loki has his magic, kept that under his hat till the last, most unexpected moment - but whatever dimension the TVA is in is not conducive to magic at all. Conversely, this means that the Stones and Loki\\'s magic will probably work normally outside the TVA.\\n\\n- B-15, the field agent in the room, has to explain to the Judge that Loki is trying to use magic, that\\'s how little magic matters here. Everyone else just sniggers because Loki looks fucking ridiculous, they don\\'t associate the action with power in any way. Very cool.\\n\\n- Loki loses his cool after the Judge loses patience with his bullshit and sentences him to be reset. \"You will not dictate how my story ends!\" Fuck, that\\'s pretty fucking meta.\\n\\n- \"And who are you?\" Now, if that isn\\'t the start of a beautiful bromance, I don\\'t know what is.\\n\\n- As Loki and Mobius walk out of the courtroom without Loki\\'s Hunter babysitter, \"SYF\" is printed on the wall. We see this abbreviation next to a button in the elevator in the next scene, it\\'s the top floor. No idea what it stands for.\\n\\n- Beautiful shot of the wider TVA. Place is fucking massive. Don\\'t see any kind of weather, it seems like a bustling metropolis. I assume they\\'re in a similar building to the ones outside. Score slaps here, back to that beautiful theremin. Wonder if this is the inside of the alleged city that we might have seen for a split second in _Ant-Man and the Wasp_.\\n\\n- surely Loki has seen cities built without any magic before? Maybe he hasn\\'t seen this architectural style before in the absence of magic? It does seem a little physics-bending. Sakarr seemed pretty rationally built, besides the massive trash wormholes. Also, \"That\\'s not real.\" Yeah, it\\'s CGI, mate 😉\\n\\n- Mobius just takes everything this fucker says in his stride. You wanna set fire to everything? Fuck, do my desk first! And this place is just stuffed full of paperwork, so it\\'ll burn nicely for ya, champ!\\n\\n- So, there\\'s a nightmare department at the TVA. What the hell. Do the TVA police dreams too? That is twisted as fuck. Does this have comics precedent?\\n\\n- haha, the elevator music is Schubert, from that eyeball scene in _Avengers_! Very cool.\\n\\n- Agent Mobius M. Mobius, Owen Wilson\\'s character, finally introduces himself in the elevator as \"Agent Mobius\". (We don\\'t know his full name in-story just yet, though.)  Like I said before, it\\'s a weird-ass name that I wouldn\\'t be surprised was a pseudonym. I know his name is straight from the comics, but I wonder if there\\'ll be an in-universe explanation for it. Is his middle name also Mobius lol? Anyway, \\'Mobius\\' ostensibly comes from the Mobius strip, a circular one-sided construct. Contains a twist, inherent in its design. (Probably more to Mobius than meets the eye, then!) Interestingly, cassette tapes, which seem to form the basis of the holoprojector in the Time Theatre, can contain a Mobius strip as a way of doubling recording area. (Facilitating Loki adding more to his life\\'s story?) Could also be some kind of code name.\\n\\n- \"I thought you didn\\'t like to talk.\" This show has basically been pure exposition for the last twenty minutes, but it\\'s been handled so well with Hiddleston\\'s Loki \"What the fuck is this shit???\" Laufeyson. I think the humour and the freshness of the setting really make the time fly by. Watching this still-a-egotistical-dickhead Loki have all the shit he\\'s taken for granted ripped away from him is perversely captivating. Also, the above quote tells us that Mobius might be nice but he\\'s also a clever fucker who might actually know what he\\'s getting into with Loki.\\n\\n- and into Time Theatre 25, where Loki will get to  do a ~~MCU~~ Sacred Timeline rewatch! That\\'s all kinds of meta.\\n\\n- I have to say, I love the next scenes. It\\'s so philosophical, like nothing I\\'ve seen before in the MCU outside of Bucky\\'s therapy sessions.\\n\\n- \"There\\'s only one person you can trust.\" \"Yourself? I like it. Slap it on a t-shirt!\" Mobius is literally gonna show this dude a version of himself in the future - trust away, Loki. Odds are you\\'re not gonna like what you see. \\n\\n- \"You\\'ve always lived within your set path.\" Well, shit. Implication of no real free will in the MCU. An ant has no quarrel with a boot.\\n\\n- I like the quickdraw from Mobius and the little cowboy riff that plays in the score when Mobius uses the time twister on Loki before he attacks. Cute\\n\\n- haha, Loki actually points at the only other chair in the room, fucking requesting permission to sit down. It\\'s probably physical sarcasm. \"Alright if I sit here then, your Worship? Won\\'t rewind me, will ya?\"\\n\\n------------\\nSecond half in a comment below.',\n",

I get it, the film\\'s wording is somewhat confusing here, but I don\\'t think this is how time travel works.\\n\\nFirstly, just by changing anything in the past, you would create a branched timeline. Removing an Infinity Stone is just an example of changing something in the past to create a new timeline, you don\\'t have to remove a Stone to do so.\\n\\nSecondly, a timeline without an Infinity Stone wouldn\\'t collapse, at least not just because its Stone-less.

We are told there are several of them, presumably from different variants seeing as there’s more than one of each stone, and some people even use them as paper weights. This is basically saying “These infinity stones are useless here.” That’s what you think right? Well maybe that’s not the truth. Maybe the infinity stones we see are actually fake. Think about it. There are multiple of the same stones, which have a logical explanation, which is that they are just from different variants. But at the same time, it would also make sense if they were just fake. That’s as logical as an explanation as them being confiscated from different variants. You might be going “well what about the tesseract? It’s useless there too so doesn’t that mean it’s true? Well maybe the tesseract they gave loki was fake. This would explain why he couldn’t use it.\\n• Well how come he can’t use his powers? Well it’s kinda simple. We see that when he attempts to use his power he’s wearing his collar. So maybe this collar also prevents power usage. I mean, this place has insane technology and the type of people they are probably arresting… would most likely be better off with a collar that makes them unable to use their powers. \\n• In summary there’s a pattern here: all of these things are leading a person to believe they are powerless. I mean, if someone tells you these things are useless in this place your likely just gonna not even try to use them. You’ve been told they are useless and you’ve seen first hand that they are. This is important. They are basically making you feel like you can’t do anything, so don’t try to. This is smart. And something important but small in the first episode is what Loki says.

It created an interesting dynamic of \"what do we do when we lose our heroes?\" That\\'s no easy question to answer, and dare I say one of the most interesting questions posed in the superhero movie genre since Watchmen (don\\'t hate, I love that movie to death).\\n\\nBut Endgame, man... I love the movie but it created a long lasting issue that I was having a crisis with in the MCU for years prior. That there\\'s ultimately no long lasting consequences to this universe because everyone either comes back after death, or gets replaced by Hero V2.\\n\\nTo give a few examples (out of the far too many I can think of): \\n\\nIron Man. In the first three movies, love or hate the sequels, Tony feels like he goes through an emotional arc/evolution as a character. It invests me in the character and makes me care about what he\\'ll do in the future. And then all he does the next few movies is be a douche to everyone, occasionally fight and make a few jokes before screwing off until the next team up. It feels like the evolution is completely wasted, but hey he dies in Endgame so it had a character conclusions, right? Sure. Except now Pepper and an undisclosed party a few movies from now, are taking up the mantle. So the universe still has Iron Man. Tony\\'s dead, but Iron Man lives on. Cool.\\n\\nCaptain America. Glues the Avengers together and brings an old school sense of justice back to a century of moral grays and political strife. Giving a similar sacrifice as Tony when he chooses to return all the Stones to the correct timelines and says goodbye to all of his friends because he believes he deserves to be happy. It\\'s honestly a kind of selfish decision, and frankly it made me like the character more because it showed his human side that we\\'ve only really glimpsed in the past. Then Sam becomes the next Captain America. And arguably, he\\'s even more powerful than before. Okay. Cool, so that\\'s yet another hero they just can\\'t let stay dead.\\n\\nLoki. This one in particular, borderline infuriates me. After turning Thor into a complete wack comedic relief (which I don\\'t entirely hate but it is a massive change) they finally give him a reason to be unhinged and enraged. Thanos straight up murders Loki in brutal fashion, right after the two brothers had finally made some sort of amends. It gives Thor a purpose, and it makes us invested in his fight against Thanos. Then Loki lives because they screw up a timeline, and he teleports away so that Disney can give him a series and capitalize on that money train. I get it, I genuinely do get it. BUT, why? Why not just focus on another Asgardian? Introduce something new instead of just refusing to bother creating a reason to care.\\n\\nThere\\'s just... So many other examples I can think of but this post is already getting a bit long in the tooth. This is to say nothing of instances like Dormammu from Dr. Strange, The Flag Smashers from FWS, the new Vision from WV (I mean Paul Bettany said his contract is done so...) There\\'s just... God there\\'s so much.\\n\\nLook, I won\\'t pretend to not understand how difficult it must be to link these all together and not find yourself constantly stepping on proverbial toes and creating plot holes and all that. I can forgive plot holes in a sprawling universe like this. That\\'s just bound to happen. However, what is TOTALLY avoidable is making me feel like there is no consequences to liking certain characters. \\nLove or hate it, but at least in things like Game of Thrones, The Boys, Invincible, Watchmen etc I walk away feeling like a character I love or hate could bite the bullet and not be replaced by anyone.\\n\\nI can never feel that with the MCU post-Endgame.\\n\\nTL;DR I\\'m sad, mad and disappointed in the MCU after watching the latest Loki episode.

You can\\'t move your foot because the foot/you are not worthy, and we are not taking Chris Evans\\' foot into account for the sake of discussion. \\n\\n\\nI guess in Ragnarok he did put it on the dragon\\'s mouth in the beginning to hold it down, and it didn\\'t really mess up the dragon.

It would be way funnier if I could actually buy that this warrior was genuinely trying to comfort someone by calling them ugly.\\n\\nStar Lord\\'s jokey side also works better the more he has \"cool\" moments, like the epic way he escapes prison only for it to turn out that he did it for a Walkman. Star-Lord being a loser reached peak ridiculousness when they tried to imply that his beefcake self was getting fat.

The movie went a decent amount of time without a joke, giving the moment more payoff. In Guardians 2, the scene is barely given time to be dramatic when the joke comes out. Like the reveal that Ego killed his mother is immediately followed with him goofily changing into Michael Knight for no reason.\\n\\nThe first movie letting dramatic scenes play out like Peter saving Gamora with his helmet, not only improves the dramatic scenes in my opinion, but also gives the jokes more payoff.\\n\\nNow I get people arguing for the second movie being better since it does have an emotional payoff, and I see why people would say the plot is better, but even then, I find the first movie\\'s way of inserting jokes to be undoubtedly superior.

In the comics he's like a space Hulk and designed to kill Thanos. He's extremely strong and not to be messed with. He even ripped Thanos' heart out with his bare hands. But in the MCU he barely gets to show his true strength and is mostly there for the comedy and jokes. He also never got the chance to get his revenge on Thanos(for killing his wife and daughter) and never even interacted with Thanos.\\n\\nSo to me, it looks like the MCU doesn't really know how to handle their strongmen and kinda put them aside for the jokes and comedy and doesn't let them show their immense strength. But they do let their universal powerhouses like Thor, Carol, Wanda and Strange shine in all their glory and know how to handle them.\\n\\nSo my question is, how do you guys see them handle Ben Grimm/The Thing. I know that Ben and Johnny always have fun banter, but Ben is more than that.\\n\\nSidenote: I do have to say that I was fine how they handled the Hulk in Endgame. I think it was a great moment when Bruce realized that only he was strong enough to survive the snap to bring everyone back. He's come a long way since that conversation with Tony in The Avengers.\",\n",

Okay. This logic/model is evident as the 2014 Nebula of the alternate timeline is killed by the Nebula of the original timeline - 2023 - and the latter does not disappear from existence. Prof. The Hulk was to return the Gems to their respective points in time and not create any more timelines [Returning the Gems or not, there would still be different timelines; if they didn\\'t, they would create more. Therefore, that alternative scene should not be used as arguments, only the one in the final version.], as they had already created several in Time Heist, and they could not leave those lines to the mercy of evil beings.\\n\\n2°) It is explained in TVA that what the Avengers did was destined to happen --- and that, therefore, it was not a disturbance to the temporal flow. We understand, therefore, that they are not limited to being against the creation of alternative timelines --- only in \"non-destined\" cases.\\n\\nIn the first episode, we see that, when capturing Loki Variante, they use a kind of reset bomb in the timeline. Ok. The scene shows the effect of the bomb, but it doesn\\'t show that timeline being totally destroyed.\\nThe question is: How does the reset work?  Does the reset work after a certain time?\\n\\nThe TVA agents did this in a way that didn\\'t affect the Avengers\\' time travel --- and therefore didn\\'t cause possible paradoxes [\"If the Avengers were there in the destroyed timeline and that was the same line as the Loki Variant, like did they make the other trips --- if they were erased from existence\"]? That is, from a time when the Avengers had already left that line, then?\\n\\nAvengers Fail on Time Heist in 2012 &gt; Loki runs away with one of the Gem of Space/Tesseract &gt; Avengers get out of that timeline &gt;ki Loki falls in the desert &gt; TVA acts, as the Avengers were destined to create other timelines and travel through time, understanding the Loki Variant. So starting FROM A SPECIFIC TIME [2012 - hour x, minute y, second z, thousandth] destroys that line. Not to mess up the time travel/timeline creations --- that were meant --- of the Avengers. In other words, they didn\\'t erase all the events on that line, but after a certain point, preventing it from continuing to exist.\\n\\nOr was that reality not destroyed and just blocked, similar to what they did with a \"Time War\" (Dr. Who), which is isolated by a \"bubble\", preventing anyone from going there?',\n",

The most paradoxical sort of time travel is Harry Potter and Dark, which is not the MCU’s way.\\n\\nYou can’t time travel in the MCU, at least, you can’t in your own timeline. You don’t even really time travel; instead you hop to a different timeline at a certain point. Time isn’t linear; it’s all happening at once, so you can point at a single spot at a finished tapestry rather than wait for the spot to be woven.\\n\\nCap returns the stones back to their original placements, meaning he does not change the course of the 3ish timelines. It’s even possible in some other universe that they take our MCU’s stones, but we don’t notice because their Cap did it secretly.\\n\\nNow we don’t know which Peggy this is. It could be our Peggy, in which Steve does actually time travel somehow (Harry Potter style, where the past/future isn’t changed because it was always like that), or this is a different timeline’s Peggy, in which case in every universe, every Peggy is with a different one’s Cap.\\n\\nThat Cap we see at the end of Endgame doesn’t even have to be ours. It could be a different timeline’s Cap that boinks our Peggy.\\n\\nYou have to look at it as a wide structure of timelines intersecting each other rather than our timeline causing all the trouble. If we can interact with them, they can interact with us, therefore, it is likely our timeline has been affected by other people (chiefly Steve in our concern), but we don’t notice the change, because it’s supposed to happen. So far, the rules of the TVA make sense as it’s plausible all of this was supposed to happen. \\n\\nOr this post could be thrown out the window as we discover the TVA is horribly mismanaged, leading to Loki’s interruption and the Multiverse of Madness.',\n",

       "       'Hello there!\\n\\nI saw Loki and I loved it! However, I have a problem with the \"Sacred Timeline\". It doesn\\'t actually make any sense. Let me explain.\\n\\nThis \"Sacred Timeline\" was created after a multiversal war and the timekeepers emerged and agreed upon the proper flow of time, calling this new timeline the \"Sacred Timeline\". The show leads us to believe that the events of the current MCU as we\\'ve seen them so far, are part of the \"Sacred Timeline\".\\n\\nHowever, there are some inconsistencies with which events are considered part of the sacred timeline. In the show, we see Agent Mobius showing Loki the events of the following movies: Avengers, Thor: TDW, Thor: Ragnarok, and Infinity War. Mobius says that \"That\\'s the way it\\'s supposed to happen. That\\'s the proper flow of time\". So this leads me to believe the events of these movies (as we saw them) are part of the sacred timeline.\\n\\nHowever, the judge (can\\'t remember her name), says that \"What the avengers did, was supposed to happen\" in reference to the time-travelling events from Endgame. This implies that the events of Endgame are also part of the sacred timeline. This implies that the sacred timeline includes the events from the first \"Avengers\" film and the time-travelling events from \"Avengers: Endgame\", which really cannot be the case.\\n\\nHow is it that the sacred timeline includes the events of the Battle of New York without any time-travel interference and includes the events of the Battle of New York with the time-travel interferance from the 2023 Avengers?\\n\\nI mentioned this theory to my brother and he said that, because Steve Rogers returned the Infinity Stones, he essentially \"clipped\" all the alternate branches, thereby restoring the timeline back to the sacred timeline. I initially bought this, however, I realized, there\\'s once again a problem.\\n\\nHow was Steve Rogers able to live in the past with Peggy Carter? This absolutely cannot be apart of the sacred timeline, we know that Peggy got married with... someone else (I think she mentions him in a deleted scene in The Winter Solider). I don\\'t believe that this man would have \"always been Steve Rogers\". Some movies/TV (like that one Harry Potter movie), portray the time-travel as having always occurred (in the background). However, I think this isn\\'t the way that time travel has been established to work in the MCU. Now, the argument could be made that, the 2023 Avengers were always in the background of the first Avengers movie, however, I don\\'t believe this is the case, because when the 2023 Avengers time travel back to 2014 (to the beginning of the first Guardians film), they literally knock Peter Quill out, which didn\\'t happen in the original film.\\n\\nAll of these different timelines cannot all be sacred, since there is only one sacred timeline. So far, it seems to me the following timelines are all \"sacred\" (since the TVA did not interfere to our knowledge). The timeline that includes Peggy without Steve, the timeline that includes Peggy with Steve, the events of the first Avengers without time travellers, and the events of the first Avengers with time time travellers, etc. (This includes Guardians and Thor: TDW (the other films the 2023 Avengers time travelled to)).\\n\\nI really do believe that the sacred timeline doesn\\'t make sense the way they\\'ve explained it in the show. Was Steve allowed to stay with Peggy as long as he kept his head down and didn\\'t meddle with affairs too much? Are there variants of Steve Rogers that got arrested for attempting to interfere throughout the years? Should Steve have been arrested in the first place for choosing to stay in the past and live with Peggy? I think he should have, I absolutely think Steve should have been hauled into the TVA, since what he does contradicts the events of the sacred timeline. What do you think?',\n",

In other words: Tiny Hero has not edited every single Marvel trailer in existence lol. The trailers that they have edited, you may not have ever even seen before, but their style is one that\\'s really fun and unique. Also, the fact that Adam is not just willing but excited to answer questions like this, is awesome! ...just be \"reasonable\" with your questions please :) Adam\\'s been really cool in expressing that he doesn\\'t want to limit any questions, as it is an \"Ask Me Anything,\" but if you\\'re asking about which Marvel trailer will drop next and when or something like that... you\\'re probably not going to get an answer :P',\n",

There where some scenes which where brilliant, Loki looking at his past, the interview etc, but some parts had off acting.

Simple, they cleaned up after themselves. It’s ok under the TVAs rules to visit a neighboring timeline, even borrow stuff from it, so long as you follow “leave no trace” rules, like camping. \\n\\nLoki on the other hand would never willingly return to SHEILD captivity, so he’s the criminal even though it wasn’t his time machine that created the potential divergence. \\n\\nThis also means that cap, lining in the “dance with Peggy” timeline is permitted, since who cares. but the TVA would have strong words with him if he ever attempted to affect world affairs (I remember this being a criticism of his actions at the end of endgame “so he just lets shield be taken over by hydra?”) \\n\\nThe TVA can roll back divergent timelines, but cannot roll back Loki’s escape, since that also erases the avengers trip to 1960, which is canon. \\n\\nAnyway I know this is probably full of holes since all time travel stories are but it’s fun to pick at.',\n",

Thus, that event and those actions were woven into the Sacred Timeline by the Time Keepers.  (similar to how we see other branches in the animated lesson).  \\n\\nMy theory is that Steve and Peggy were always \"meant to be\".  And it was Steve opting to stay with Peggy in 1949 that resolved that \"destiny\".  While such an action might have typically (and otherwise) caused another branch, the Time Keepers either wove that back into the \"Sacred Timeline\" or they allowed the \"Variant Steve\" to live his life anonymously in the Sacred Timeline until showing up with the shield (after \"prime Steve\" had left the timeline.)\\n\\nWhether or not the TVA intervened and told Steve directly not to screw with fate or not, or if the fibre of his character just did so naturally is irrelevant.  -- And as for those who want to believe that was Peggy that Loki saw being hauled into the TVA, maybe it was, maybe it wasnt.

       "       'With the recent casting of Titania in the She-Hulk series, I\\'ve been reminded that Ruffalo\\'s next appearance will likely be in that show, and I\\'m curious to know what his next arc might be. \\n\\nI\\'m one of a handful of people who haven\\'t liked the direction taken with him in Infinity War and Engame. While it makes sense and connected Banner to the plot, I missed seeing the monster come out, and don\\'t feel like Hulk has gotten a chance to show him being \"the strongest there is\". I think this is becoming an increasingly popular opinion from Hulk fans, but I also think Marvel likely has plans for Hulk to address this.\\n\\nWe know that Marvel (at least as of the last major update) can\\'t make a solo Hulk movie unless they want Universal to distribute it. However, they can use Hulk in team up movies.  We know Marvel takes a lot of arcs from the comics and merges them together into a new arc. Planet Hulk was loosely adapted by Ragnarok, while at the same time covering Odin\\'s death and Hela\\'s resurgence. We also know that Marvel has announced movies that include characters from both if its previous D+ shows: Dr Strange 2 for Wanda, and Cap 4 for Sam. \\n\\nHere\\'s the theory: Hulk\\'s next appearance will be as the villain in the next team up movie Avengers 4: Future Imperfect, which will be set up by some of the D+ shows, but also can tie into Antman 3 or Engame for audiences who haven\\'t seen the D+ series. \\n\\nWhile I\\'m not sure where Loki will go, I\\'d put my money on the TVA and their mission either being done away with or rendered obsolete at the end of Loki. The end of the show could set up Kang or other characters from the future, who have a bone to pick with the Avengers for their actions in the current timeline, and the TVA might be unable to stop their interference. \\n\\nSo where does Hulk fit in? In She-hulk, I theorize that we will see Jen and Bruce (in flashbacks) prior to the events of Endgame, and Jen will help with the process of merging Banner and Hulk. We may also see more of Banner navigating life as the Smart Hulk. The theory is that we\\'ll also see signs that Smart Hulk is not completely fine, and there are some lingering issues from the merge. \\n\\nThen, in Antman 3, Kang will be introduced. He has opened a rift from the future, explaining that the Avengers have ruined the future through meddling with time. Their fight with Thanos actually created another villain, who is successful at bringing the earth to its knees. Antman will stong Kang, but see signs that he\\'s right. And here\\'s where the theory pays off:\\n\\nAvengers 4 will see an evil Hulk (the Maestro) use the tear in time from Kang to revisit the past. When Hulk and Banner \\'merged\\' psyches, they instead created a third psyche (this is similar to Professor Hulk\\'s story in the comics), which will slowly evolve into Maestro due to the surge of Gamma energy from his snap. Maestro is an incredibly smart Hulk with no morals and all of Hulk\\'s power, who can convincingly fight most of the Avengers team, and has a plan to remove any of them that he might struggle with (Dr. Strange/Wanda). In order to stop him, Hulk either dies (so future him never conquers the world) or has to decide to unmerge, once again giving up the happiness Banner has earned to go back to a state of Hulk and Banner sharing control, allowing Marvel to continue his story. \\n\\n In this way, Marvel can circumvent the \"no Hulk solo movie\" requirement from Marvel, while also telling a story that uses comic history in a new way, and provides additional connective tissue for the previous movies. What does everybody think? Would you be in favor of seeing Hulk as the villain?\\n\\nTLDR; Hulk will show up as the Maestro in Avengers 4, a side effect of the Avengers using time travel to get the stones for Hulk to un-snap.',\n",

But for the MCU, bringing in Doom within the next few years won't give him the same gravitas for Secret Wars just a few years down the road.  \\n\\nBut Loki will have that gravitas for the MCU.  In the current TV show, Loki becomes very familiar with the multiverse and how it works.  He (temporarily?) gives up on his dreams of domination, and instead starts being more of a multiversal nomad, meeting a wide variety of characters and learning new skills/powers (as he cameos all over the MCU in the coming years).  As the storyline climaxes, Loki will be positioned the way Doom was at the end of the Secret Wars build, off to the side of the main Avengers story but the only one with the powers and skills to save the Multiverse.  And then the next Endgame-level event centers around the MCU's most iconic and long-running villain.\",\n",

Very little details of Loki episode 1 was referenced here, but it basically analyzed their rules on time travel. I would also mention other MCU movies here, and if you haven\\'t watched them (why wouldn\\'t you?!!!), please watch them and then go back here. Cherio\\n\\nAs what we\\'ve all known, if an infinity stone is taken to another timeline from its home reality, it then creates another branched reality. Such happenings is only done when - in this case - a person from the main timeline \"deliberately escapes in said timeline\".\\n\\nQuestions:\\n\\n1. Why is **Loki** the one that is sought for, and not the **Avengers**?\\n2. In regards to Steve Rogers\\' return as Old Man Cap, the opinions of Markus and McFeely, and the Russo Brothers do not coincide. Does it prove that there was the old man Cap is in a different reality?\\n\\nMy thoughts:\\n\\n1. The very moment that a person brought a stone to travel through time would automatically create a branched reality that would slowly become a timeline that would completely divert away from the main timeline. The further it is, the less likely the reality can be sorted out. (*If you\\'re an unlucky lad who found your way to the time stone, and used it to correct your ways just to prevent yourself from humiliating yourself in front of your elementary crush, congratulations my friend - you\\'ll serve in the TVA.)* However, the Avengers were given the exception rule by the Time Keepers. Why, you may ask? **It was supposed to happen**, they said...... But still, why? How? Is it just really allowed by the Timekeepers? Does their method of time travel stick to the main timeline ONLY? The Avengers\\' method of time travel is still full of loopholes. They created branched realities the moment they stole the stones, which at that moment produced at least 3 new branched realities - that still exists BEFORE returning the stones. Following the rules: The separate teams travel suit to the main timeline (Team Iron Man, Team Thor, and Team Blackwidow), although with differing \"time destinations\". But, moving forward AFTER taking the stones, they should travel in different timelines, each with different outcomes (stealing an Infinity Stone is a huge deviation to the main timeline). It\\'s an \"**interreality**\" travel, so to speak. The reasoning behind this is that they still created a branched reality in that time period, *until the stones were perfectly returned to the way it was, since it was \"made to happen, as it should be\".* \\n\\n*But why not Loki?* For storytelling, I guess.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n2. Steve went back in time to perfectly return the stones to where it happened (*The complexity on how it was done was never disclosed to us, but I think it\\'s too much to handle*). After returning the stones, instead of going back to the main timeline, he decided to live his life as he should be by going back home and spend time with his beloved Peggy Carter. On what reality though? IF following the rules, Steve created a new reality in which there were two Captain Americas - one in the ice, one right beside Peggy. Although this is quite vague as there is no sufficient evidence to prove on when exactly did Steve return (either after the events of The First Avenger or before). This is still supported when Steve visited Peggy on her dementia state when she lost her memories and said \"Steve, you came back!\" \\n\\nHowever, some contradictions would say that there has been two instances of Steve Rogers in the same main timeline, where old man Cap married Peggy Carter, had two children, and was theorized that old man cap was on the funeral of Peggy Carter\\'s death.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWell, what do you guys think?',\n",

He is something of a mixture of horned deities from other religions, including Pan, **Cernunnos**, Baphomet, Janicot, Osirus and **Satan**, who’s also based on pagan gods. Part of the appeal of the Horned God is that it celebrates gods and iconography that Christianity has demonized. Another god that’s experienced this? Our dear Loki, conflated with the devil by Snorri Sturluson, the Christian who recorded Norse Mythology and rewrote it to fit a Chrisitan template.\\n\\nSo, I posit that this show will explore the concept of Loki as the ‘Devil’ - that his designation as an evil entity has been misrepresented or foisted upon him by others, including himself (“I am a Villain” as a line from Loki seems to set this up), when in actuality he is something more akin to an important natural force, unfairly demonized.\\n\\nMore on the Horned God - he represents nature, wilderness, the hunt, and the cycle of life and death. He is usually depicted as theriocephalic\\xa0- which means having a beast’s head. In his case, usually a stag or ram. This symbolizes the **union of the divine with the animal**, and blurs the line between man and animal for the same purpose. He is considered a **god of dualities**: light and darkness, night and day, summer and winter, good and evil, love and hate, death and rebirth, sun and moon - hence the symbol. **The two horns symbolize this duality**. Funnily enough, Tom Hiddleston recently mentioned that the meaning of Loki’s horns would be explored in the show.\\xa0 It also puts this symbol in direct conflict with Dagaz, a rune that’s literally imprinted all over the TVA. Dagaz ᛞ symbolizes Non-Duality, a thing that is itself only, Everlasting. And it looks like an Hourglass, how convenient.\\n\\nTo touch again on the **death and rebirth** thing - some Wiccans see him as dying on a specific date (there are various, but a popular one is Samhain) and then reborn again on the Winter Solstice. He is a god who literally dies and resurrects himself, much like the changing of seasons, though interestingly he returns for Winter, not Spring.\\n\\nHe is seen as mediator between the unknowable, vast supreme deity of the universe (Dryghtyn) and regular humans. He is also the consoler of the bereaved, as he is also the bridge between life and death and can give comfort to those separated by it.\\n\\nHe is the God of Witches and Sorcerers, and sometimes called by the name **’The Sorcerer**’.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n[Kaunaz\\\\/Kenaz resembles the \\\\&lt; sign, but is actually the ancestor to our letter K](https://preview.redd.it/lie4afhicw471.png?width=2180&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da968c6b5bbdef9017f8afc89fc91cab8ccbbbf2)\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nKaunaz means \\'Torch’, symbolizing \\'The search for Knowledge/Creativity, and how the use of it can bring prosperity or destruction’. It is also known as the \\'Loki Rune’, so of course it’d be here!\\n\\nAlso to note, the star Sirius was known as Lokabrenna to the Norse, or \\'Loki\\'s Torch\\'. As the brightest star in the sky used for navigation, this implies Loki as a guide and is a noteworthy positive and important role, especially for sailors like the Vikings.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b26lab3kcw471.png?width=2156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6e9b85a8fc8fc62bf8ea2d405f27b8fc447f641\\n\\n**Othala/Odal,** which is of course an \\'O’.

It also means ’**heart**’, as it is at the center of the alphabet. Finally, it means to ’**teach, learn or guide**’. Gaining knowledge is said to bring a person closer to God as they come to know his creation. *(This does remind me of Kaunaz and its \\'search for knowledge’.)*\\n\\nThe name comes from its shape, which is a **shepherd’s staff**. This was used by the shepherd to guide his animals, \\'teaching’ them the right way to go, or, should they fall, using the hook to lift them out of dangerous places.\\n\\nHowever, I think it might actually be a reference to this symbol - or rather, its ancestor -\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/etopbytscw471.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f77c85bfa71b3c7f720a74aaf6004d4856d9218b\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThis was a symbol made for The Blue Öyster Cult , they of “Don’t Fear the Reaper” fame.

It is meant to symbolize questioning authority and the systems that govern men.

In time, his son, Zeus, would kill him. Both he and Zeus were the youngest of their sibling sets, and both became King of the Gods thereafter. MCU Loki is the youngest of his sibling set, and kinda maybe wants to be king? Ish? He says he does but he doesn’t try all that hard. He does kill his biological father, Laufey, though, and contributes to circumstances that kill Odin, his adoptive father.\\n\\nBut more importantly, Cronus was conflated with the Roman God Saturn.\\n\\nSome differences between them - Saturn was not killed by Zeus, but exiled. He ruled Latium in peace and harmony, and presided over Saturnalia, a festival famous for role reversal, where slaves would become the masters and the masters the slaves. It also featured wild dancing, gambling, and the appointment of a King of Saturnalia, who would make ridiculous commands that must be obeyed for the express purpose of causing chaos and mischief (these might be “Sing naked!” or “throw that guy in the lake!”). It is thought the Feast of Fools and its Lord of Misrule have a relation to this celebration, if you’re fans of Disney’s *The Hunchback of Notre Dame* like I am. The King of Saturnalia was created to expressly mock the rule of one man, a backlash to the appointment of emperors over the traditional social and political networks of Rome. **It is meant to make ridiculous the notion of a single all-powerful man presiding over the fates of everyone.**\\n\\nBoth Saturn and Cronus are harvest gods, which is why both are usually depicted with a scythe. It’s actually from him that we get our image of **the Grim Reaper.**\\n\\nAnd now we briefly come back to Blue Öyster Cult. The reason they chose the symbol of Cronus was because it represents his Scythe, and therefore invokes the Reaper. (He used this to castrate Uranus before killing him, by the by, fun fact, enjoy that image, and respect how I didn’t spend ten minutes trying to make an adolescent pun about Uranus and private parts).\\n\\nYou ever wonder why Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday are named for Norse Gods (Tyr, Wodan, Thor, and Frey/Freya/Frigg), Monday and Sunday are named for celestial bodies, and then Saturday just waltzes in like how are you is this the right address for the party and then collapses drunk on your couch, having been named after a Roman Titan?\\n\\nInteresting thoughts on that. We’re not sure it is named for Saturn. It might come from **Sætere**, another god of the harvest, possibly of Slavic origin. He is described as bearing a scythe and being a complicated god, both good and evil. His name means \\'setter of traps, insidiator, plotter’. It is thought this name is another kenning for…yeah, you guessed it. Many think that **Loki** was conflated with Saturn and the resulting hybrid was named **Sætere.** So Saturday is in fact **Sætere\\'s Day.** Loki has a day of the week named after him after all.\\n\\nAnother couple of gods who got conflated? Cronus and Chronos, God of Time. They also became the same figure, making Cronus/Saturn/Chronos the **God of Time.** Which is why all of them are depicted with Scythe and that symbol is also a symbol for Time. Someone else based on this conglomerate figure?\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4nlmayovcw471.png?width=1606&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0640d8641717e5e98b5de50b1419d7e20f8e3472\\n\\n**Father Time.** A kindly, bearded man depicted as lording over time with a scythe in hand and an hourglass at his side. He is usually depicted at the new year by cartoonists as representing the old year, handing off the baton to **Baby New Year.** It is another symbol of **Death and Rebirth** \\\\- the idea of something new coming out of the destruction of the old. This is also the meaning of **Ragnarök** of course.\\n\\nIt seems interesting that there may be a reference that links Death, Time, and Loki all together in a single symbol here. Even if I\\'m off about that symbol, I think it\\'s good to know about the links all these figures have throughout history, and how they shaded each other.\\n\\nAny other thoughts on these?',\n",

Now, this may sound a lot like the Mephisto theories that were all over the internet during WandaVision, but I am much more resolved in this theory than I was about any WandaVision theory. First and foremost, here\\'s the evidence:\\n\\n* The show involves time travel and alternate timelines. \\n* Gugu Mbatha-Raw is playing Ravonna Renslayer who, if you read the comics or watched Avengers: Earth\\'s Mightiest Heroes (which I highly recommend) then you know has a major connection to Kang. \\n* Jonathan Majors has been cast to play Kang as the main antagonist of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, and some insiders have said that he\\'ll debut in the role via a brief appearance in Loki. \\n\\nNow, here\\'s my full theory. I believe that the time-keepers, the multiversal war, and the \"sacred timeline\" are all BS, and the TVA itself is a facade. The true leader is Kang, with his lover Ravonna carrying out his agenda while he watches from the shadows. His ultimate goal is to prevent the destruction of the future world he comes from by making sure the timeline stays unaltered, and he will go to extreme and even murderous lengths to do so.

I also thought that similar to Spider-man 2 where the opening titles were used to retell the events of the first film, this one might do a similar thing in retelling the events of the first Doctor Strange film, as well as Infinity War, Endgame, and Wandavision.\\n\\nI know that Danny Elfman is doing the music this time, but after I had this thought I went and listened to Micharl Giachinno's theme for Strange, and I could easily see it being used for a title sequence similar to the Spider-man ones.\",\n",

And finally the MCU can give some spotlight to the side characters of the MCU like Falcon (now Captain America), Winter Soldier, Scarlet Witch, Vision, Loki, War Machine and Hawkeye. But the one character that deserves some spotlight, that has long been ignored in the MCU is The Hulk/Bruce Banner. \\n\\n\\nI know he is in She-Hulk, but he is only gonna be a side character in that show, yet again. The MCU has been great for Marvel fans. I can't even imagine how satisfied long time Iron Man, Captain America and Thor fans are. But if I had to guess, the one fanbase that isn't happy with what the MCU has done to a character, is Hulk fans. The Hulk is one of the most iconic comic book characters ever, up there with Batman, Superman, Spider Man and Xmen. But in the MCU, he has been nothing more than a punching bag for the other Marvel heroes and villains. \\n\\n\\nI know Universal own the distribution rights to any Hulk-related film projects. But that's not an issue with Disney+. Marvel have a way around the problem now if the film rights didn't revert altogether. That is why Marvel can make a She-Hulk show, because Universal can't stop Marvel from making one. So that is also the cause with The Hulk. All I am saying is before Marvel announced a She-Hulk show, they should have done a Hulk show. Hawkeye is getting his own send off show and Black Widow is getting her own send off movie. Why can't the Hulk get the same treatment?\\n\\n\\nShe-Hulk is the future, and The Hulk is the past. But why can't the Hulk get a last hurray before he retires from the MCU? It doesn't sit right with me that The Hulk/Bruce Banner character's last appearance might be in a She-Hulk show. The Hulk deserves his own show, not again be a side character in another Marvel property. Mark Ruffalo is a fantastic actor, and it is a shame that his talents are always wasted in the MCU. All I ask for is a solo Hulk show to finally explore his different personalities in depth.\",\n",

He's the strategist in the Young Avenger team. The main theme is about self-esteem\\n\\n1st Arc: Introduced as school politics drama consists of top 10 intelligently gifted students on Earth. Cho narrates how each student has their own smart way to be the 1st, but each has their own weakness. Although extrovertedly seen cocky, instead of using their weakness to defeat them to be no 1, Cho secretly helps each student overcome his weakness in a way, and he feels internal joy for doing what he really believes is the right thing to be a good human but also hoping loves from his friends. This to show his scanning ability &amp; character\\n\\nOne day a masked shadowy group comes and with just a swing of a member's ridiculously gigantic sword destroys the whole school, but students survive. They introduced themselves as Pythagoreans ( a nod to the comic, also a nod to a real Greek cult, read Metempsychosis too) and plan to kill Cho for a reason. Then it will be the first battle: Students vs The PTGs, which became a thriller in one episode. All students killed &amp; sacrificed themselves for Cho. Cho promises to Avenge.\\n\\nEnd of 1st ep: The PTGs reveal to Cho that they are all Cho from various multiverses (same actors). Each has his own superpowers whereas Cho only can use his intellect. Unlike Loki variants, they look the same for a reason. Throughout the thriller chase, Cho is showing apparent self-esteem issue (Cockiness is actually a form of fake self-esteem, contrary to popular belief NPD is associated with suicidal behavior)\\n\\n2nd battle: Cho attempts to battle his variants, but ended looking like his variants destroying Cho. This represents self-harm, suicidal thoughts, self-guilt.\\n\\nEnd of 1st Arc: Young Avengers arrives to help.\\n\\n2nd Arc: After some battles, a YAv defeated a Cho variant and it revealed to be a Skrull. After Secret Invasion, there's huge paranoia of Skrulls within humans. Cho's showing huge anxiety behavior &amp; YAvs attempt to help. This arc represents how a friend helps a bullied or gaslight victim. Each YAvs have their own way to help. Some help, some make it worse, slandering the Skrulls as a toxic species.\\n\\nCharacter progression: From cocky, fake confidence, Cho tries to gain confidence in a sustainable way.\\n\\n3rd Arc: Final Battle of YAvs vs Cho'vars. YAvs beginning to lose. Near Climax: Cho comes out as a Skrull. A Super Skrull who can copy 1 appearance &amp; only 1 superpower at a time. Cho is actually an alien who is obsessed to be a human. After Endgame, humans are overvalued. So he picked human as appearance &amp; 1 ability of huge intellect as it's an attribute most humans valued the most nowadays.\\n\\nHe can only use 1 ability when he's human. He's Hulking Out &amp; out of disguise so he can be his maximum to save his friends. This to visually message: Self-love with an attribute that might alienate you, being ourselves not hoping for love back but for what we believe is right. A Secret War within ourselves. Also as an anti-thesis of human hate\\n\\nNext YAvs: Cho would be like a catfish influencer to humans like nowadays. Represent himself as a young Hulk for PR with TotallyAwesomeHulk as an online celeb name. Wiccan calls him Teddy as his nickname for a reason. Humans love him, but because of the previous events, Cho doesn't believe this is the right thing. Cho comes out as Skrull to public parallel Iron Man 1 but with a backslash.\\n\\nSeason 1 is about self-battle, Season 2 is about Self vs Community: Cho outta Earth to build his own kingdom.

I know it's official status is kinda hinky but nothing on-screen has ever directly contradicted the idea that they still occupy the same story space. Episode 1 of Loki challenged that but I think I've got it worked out.\\n\\nAOS creates two branching timelines; one in season 5 and the other in season 7. We'll take them one at a time.\\n\\nIn Season 5, Shield is abducted and brought to a post-apocalyptic future. Shenanigans ensue, they come back, and prevent the apocalypse in the sacred timeline. This creates a significant branch timeline but here's how I see it. The Agents, like the Avengers, had to go on that time-travel excursion in order to save the day. The Time Variance Authority can travel to any point in time and any branch of the timeline and clip it, ending the universe before it reaches the red line. So my thinking is the TVA allow the journey and once the agents have what they needed from the future, the tineline is retroactively cut at the stem. It's still part of the agents pasts because, as Banner points out in Endgame, that is immutable but the universe itself is gone. No branch.\\n\\nSeason 7 is a bit messier because of so many time jumps but essentially the same logic applies. In the first quantum incursion they create enough of a change that the timeline branches. They keep doing this throughout the season but it's all necessary for the saviour of Earth in the sacred timeline so the TVA allow it, following on the heels of the agents, wiping out the minor branches as they leave and the main branch once they return to the sacred timeline. Unfortunately, this means Deke is erased. The two variants they bring forward though are likely treated as acceptable to the main continuity though, like variant Gamora. \\n\\nI think that fills the gaps. Thoughts?\",\n",

So this variant Loki will eventually convince our 2012 Loki that once 2012 Loki hands over him/her to the TVA, there is a good chance they will prune 2012 Loki too considered TVA members are afraid to trust Loki. So 2012 Loki acts as if he works for the TVA but in the end betrays TVA and gets together with the other Loki (female Loki) to cause more chaos and end up creating a multiverse so the TVA would be trying to fix the various multiverses which would make it hard for the TVA to catch the Lokis.\\n\\n**Post Credits Scene:**\\n\\n[Wanda reading the Dark Hold](https://preview.redd.it/0j0dwnolas471.png?width=1608&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=37158d9e8046a97d63349b1e34d3c5c35dd36c45)\\n\\nBoth the Lokis are the reason why Wanda hears the twins screaming \"Mom help!!\" while reading the Dark Hold.

Wanda will be an powerful ally to Team Loki considering she is a nexus being(being which can alter probabilities and warp reality to her will) like teased in one of WandaVision\\'s commercials. Wanda doesn\\'t know that creating or expanding the multiverse will destroy everything so she thinks making/expanding the multiverse wouldn\\'t cause much harm. Dr. Strange will sure find something is wrong and the TVA contacts with him to help fix this. Mordo meanwhile tries to attack Strange and of course fails considering how powerful Strange is, when Strange can hold back Thanos in Infinity War while he has 4 stones and Strange didn\\'t even use the Time Stone, am pretty sure Mordo is no match to Strange. Once he defeats Mordo, he explains him that a multiverse is being made and might destroy everything. Once Mordo realizes this, he sides up with Strange considering that a Multiverse will break all Laws of Nature which Mordo vowed not to break.\\n\\nSpiderman may help in this too since No Way Home might involve Strange but is highly unlikely and Spiderman is useless in conflicts which involves magic.\\n\\n So Mordo teams up with Strange and Wong and TVA to take down Team Loki.\\n\\n&gt;NOTE: I KNOW THAT SOME OTHER POWERFUL VILLAINS LIKE DORMAMMU OR NIGHTMARE OR EVEN THE mEphIsTo (i am certainly not beleiving mephisto is coming here) MIGHT BE THE MAIN VILLAIN BUT MOSTLY THOSE VILLAINS WILL HELP  THE LOKIS AND WANDA TO MESS UP THE SACRED TIMELINE AND CREATE A MULTIVERSE SO PLOT WON\\'T CHANGE MUCH.

       "       '2021\\nJUNE 11\\nLOKI Premiere Editorial\\n‘Freelance’\\n\\n“LOKI” first episode is a must-stream-ASAP television series &amp; I wouldn’t be doing this pilot any justice saying anything other than just that. Whomever did the screenplay/script is a true professional and comic book connoisseur. I myself was marveled (no pun intended) let alone perplexed with how steadfast and excellent the writing was or how it literally made it seem that somebody actually cared enough about their job, and the product - to make it 2021’s best series premiere.\\n\\nIt was the best series premiere out of all of their shows, period. Leaving little to nothing left to desire; Possessing real drama, real emotion, plot points open to interpretation ( which let’s face it this is something Marvel does not do ). Shockingly, there was no unnecessary over the top CGI, crummy staged violence or action that seemed incredibly forced in.\\n\\nAbout a week prior to the refreshing pace-changing Wednesday release; Disney’s Marvel Studios head-honcho Kevin Fiege released a statement informing fans of the Cinematic Universe, that the “LOKI” mini series will indubitably have the greatest impact of all the recent content Disney+ has generated on the future of the MCU. This is something that will surely leave fans on the edge of their seats upon the consummation of the God of Mischief’s streaming on Disney+.\\n\\nAt first I was skeptical about particular castings but my skepticism was immediately met with acclaim. Monologues and dialogue done by Owen Wilson as Agent Mobius along with the superb acting and character portrayal by Tom Hiddleston was just fantastic and nothing less than immaculate. \\n\\nHiddleston’s Loki is not an easy character to develop on screen, as he’s incredibly complex and diverse while seemingly struggling with emotion with intense lucidity in his character arcs. Which makes the initial scenes done with Wilson’s Mobius, a clear sign Hiddleston has elevated from bad guy you love to watch lose to the anti-hero that we can all appreciate and cheer for this summer.\\n\\nWhen Mobius ( Wilson ) asked Loki ( Hiddleston ) “What makes LOKI tick?” I was sitting on the couch, around midnight dead tired - watching this, wide eyed like it was a PPV event, repeatedly uttering to my wife and older daughter \\n\\n“This is so good, this is amazing. I am so happy, they literally can do so much with this story, it’s just so good.”\\n\\nI literally said those words. And let me make this clear - I’m a cranky, old, sleepy disabled vet whom loves to critique. Rarely am I one to say “it’s just so good” but that scene in itself, captivated me, and showed me a side of Loki - that we have yet to see in Marvels cinematic adaptations of Thor, and The Avengers. And I for one, and completely excited for some more mischief from my favorite god, every Wednesday this summer, on Disney+.\\n\\nPF, SR.\\n\\nTL;DR - I thought the pilot was great, near perfect in my opinion.

       "       \"Kinda long hella emotional but golly I can't help it.\\n\\nSo a little context. I am and have always been a nerd I love comics though my reading later in life is surprisingly more limited mainly due to time. My introduction to alot of these characters were their respective animated shows or throwaway movies from when Marvel was only really good at writing books. I'm 23 so I missed alot of first-hand pop culture phenomena being a late nineties baby. My first star was movie was Episode 1. So ya know my nerddom is centered around Marvel and was exclusively for most of the first half of my life. Stan Lee Jack Kirby Steve Ditko Rob Leifield Jim Lee all stand as heroes in my heart. \\n\\nWith all that said. These movies. This universe. I swear I've never wanted anything more in my life. Growing up with And waiting for the proper treatment and expansion of the universe around such deeply emotionally intertwined symbols of my individualistic development was so bitter sweet. Until one faithful day, a month before my 11th birthday, I finally seen Ironman. Going into it I was expecting more elation from the sheer presence of a yet to be honored character like almost every movie experience I had up until that moment. From Spiderman 2 and X2 to Ghost Rider and Blade Trinity. I was just happy to see these characters (allbeit teasingly being from NY and never seeing any of my NY heroes together). But to not only see one of the best actualizations of a image come to life backed by a story that ultimately was more memorable after one viewing than alot of Marvel's previous efforts. It was like I was watching the memories The man and The King planted in my head when I was young come to life. Even back when the MCU was more grounded and muted it always felt like a new life to what I loved most. And for that to be the first step to an ever evolving and genre defining entity. I finally had something my mother thought was good enough to watch with me without feeling like she couldn't get invested. Something that brought life to my grandfather's childhood as well. Someone who watched all the Cap movies and Hulk movies from the last millennium as they came out. I had something good enough to talk about in school with my writing teachers and with my mentors even if they weren't longstanding needs themselves. It was almost like the world and my life gained more context from watching the things that used to get me excluded become apart of a zeitgeist I had yet to truly be apart of. It escalated my taste for movies both forward and back. I became a Star Wars Fan after being inspired to go back and see why we have this landscape at all. Now I can appreciate the Galaxy Far Far Away Palpatine being my evil wet dream. I truly am proud to see it have come so far. It has ushered in alot of cultural turning points in it's 13 years. Gave us all characters that we can invest in and cry with and love and lose all the same. And while they are of course far from perfect, there is something so uniquely present in everything they do. I've seen 100 percent of the cannon releases and about 85 % of the Machines output since it started up. Even at it's lowest points it is everything I could have hoped for and more. And knowing they are going to go out of their way to make more and more people feel seen and heard is so heartwarming. \\n\\nAs a queer black kid I grew up lonely in my heart. I never knew I could even see something as great as black panther and feel present through visualisation. I only every drifted towards characters who internally I related to but it wasn't until black panther that I truly felt the weight of representation. My eyes and heart swelled seeing my people my mother my grand parents siblings cousins and friends in these characters that 10 years prior would have been played up for non black audiences or not seen at all by non black audiences. \\n\\nEvery new step makes me fall more and more in love with it. Every Phase is a new layer of admiration. My faith in this universe has payed off tenfold and to see other people want for it's success makes me feel like I finally belong. \\n\\nAvengers Assemble is now my joyful tear trigger. And I hold out hope that I'll get to thank all of the actors main and supporting as well as the directors and Feige,  and D'esposito, and all the other people who have brought this to my life.

       "       'TL;DR - The Time Keepers are not indifferent or benevolent figures - they are self-interested, powerful figures who are intent on creating/maintaining a particular timeline in which they have that level of power and control. The TVA is a bureaucratic agency that enforces the Time Keepers authoritarian rule over what we know as the cannon MCU. \\n\\nSo I have been scratching my head a bit after watching the Loki premiere. While I loved everything about the show (acting, aesthetic, writing, etc.), by introducing the Time Keepers, the \"Sacred timeline\" and the TVA, Feige and Co. have seemingly introduced a version of determinism (basically fate) as well. On the one hand, the idea of a \"sacred timeline\" solves some of the issues brought about by introducing time travel and multiverses in Endgame, but, on the other, it also introduces a potentially worse problem. When characters are fated to do certain things (be it by God, \"the stars\", or a sepia-toned opaque bureaucracy with a love for analog tech protecting a \"sacred timeline\"), it robs them of any agency in their decisions that play out in the story. When it comes to superheroes, there are no stories of good triumphing over evil, simply events taking place as they were always meant to. I couldn\\'t shake being a bit disappointed by some of these ideas and their implications for the broader MCU.\\n\\nOn a second viewing of the episode trying to sort through these issues in my head, the scene towards the end when Loki finally admits he doesn\\'t enjoy hurting people suddenly read to me very differently than when I first watched it. \"I don\\'t enjoy hurting people,\" Loki says, \"I don\\'t enjoy it. I do it because I have to, because I\\'ve had to...because it\\'s part of the illusion. It\\'s the **cruel elaborate trick conjured by the weak to inspire fear.**\" This is a great moment for Loki as a character, finally expressing his vulnerabilities and shortcomings, and a great bit of acting by Hiddleston. But then Mobius responds, \"the desperate play for control,\" seemingly in confirmation, in a way that is almost...too eager. And it hit me: What if Loki has just fallen for someone else\\'s \"cruel elaborate trick\"? What if his initial instincts about how \"absurd\" the idea that TVA \"decides the fates of trillions of people across all planes of existence at the behest of three space lizards,\" was correct? \\n\\nThe idea of a \"sacred timeline\" and it\\'s deterministic rules are first laid out to Loki (and the audience) through the Ms. Minutes cartoon. With a now more skeptical lens of the TVA\\'s motivations, this cartoon reads as a pretty effective propaganda film. It all so cleanly lays out that there was a chaotic time long ago in which the \"multiverses battl[ed] for supremacy\" that almost resulted in the destruction of reality itself, until \"the all-knowing Time Keepers...[brought] peace,\" by uniting the timelines into one \"Sacred Timeline\", and how now \"the Time Keepers protect and preserve the proper flow of time for everyone and everything.\" This all reads as classic authoritarian logic that is told to the public to justify the regime: the great lengths that those in power go to in controlling your life are actually being done for your protection. Or, in the specific case of Loki, reality will fold in on itself unless the TVA exists to keep the Sacred Timeline intact. \\n\\nAs Ms. Minutes continues, she reveals perhaps a bit too much in saying that, \"sometimes people, like you, veer off the path **the Time Keepers created**\", and explains how the TVA go around \"fixing\" things big and small, (\"maybe you started an uprising, or were just late for work,\" as Ms. Minutes explains) as ordered by the Time Keepers. On my first viewing, this was the part that really irked me, as it basically states that the TVA could have had a hand in anything we\\'ve seen thus far in the MCU. But now, with a more skeptical eye, it reads as the authoritarian regime overstating it\\'s level of power and influence. Have the Time Keepers actually succeeded in creating a single \"Sacred Timeline\" to bring control to the multiverse? Or have they just taken one timeline, and through the ability to alter history to a certain degree within in it, now have a level of power that they use the TVA to maintain? The final tag line of the film is, \"For All Time. Always.\" Perhaps they\\'re chest-pounding just a bit too much? \\n\\nAnyways, this is long, so I guess my remaining questions are:\\n*How much of the TVA knows what\\'s going on, and how much them are just brainwashed too?\\n*Relatedly, is Mobius being honest about his motivations as a loyal solider for the TVA? Or is this going to be a story about Mobius using Loki as a tool to bring down the Time Keepers? \\n*What exactly is the extent of the Time Keeper\\'s and TVA\\'s influence? Is the \"Nightmare is another department\" bit from Mobius a hint that they are still actively battling other forces (potentially worse ones?) that want to control reality?',\n",

       "       'I feel like, from looking at the MCU community\\'s reaction to Loki that there is a bit of confusion relating to the TVA, particularly in how it concerns the rest of the greater MCU.  \\nFor now, I am mainly going to be responding to [the \"EFAP\" podcast episode of Loki Episode 1](https://youtu.be/lMBZ-sSKw0U), since I feel that it, in part, is the source of a lot of these misconceptions I am feeling; although a part of that is due to the actual writing of the show not being careful enough in parts in portraying these new ideas.  \\n\\n\\nI am going to be going over three different points I have seen talked about online, all of which being proposed in this podcast, and I will give my thoughts on them.  \\n\\n\\n&gt;**1. That \"The TVA in the MCU prohibits free will in its entirety. Every time  anyone makes any decision that goes against the Sacred Timeline they are immediately seen as criminals, and erased. ( Or \"Melted\", as its commonly called online. ). This hurts the rest of the series through the fact that every key decision in the MCU was in fact chosen by the Timekeepers, rather then by the characters themselves.\"**\\n\\nI feel that this criticism comes about through a misunderstanding of episode 1, although such a misunderstanding was likely intentional on behalf of the screenwriters due to the fact that its an opinion shared by our protagonist, Loki.  \\n\\n\\nI am going to post a except from Miss Minutes introduction video at the start of episode 1, for context.  \\n*\"Now, the timekeepers protect and preserve the proper flow of time for everyone and everything. But sometimes, people like you veer off the path the Time-Keepers created. We call those variants. Maybe you started an uprising, or were just late for work. Whatever it was, stepping off your path created a nexus event, which, left unchecked, could branch off into madness-leading into another multiversal war.*\"  \\n\\n\\nI believe people are looking to this paragraph and coming to two conclusions off of it. That the TVA considers all deviations of the Sacred Timeline as criminal, and that any \"choice\" in a temporal sense creates a new timeline.  \\nI think the miscommunication here is that the focus of Miss Minutes video is not the creation of new timelines, or going off the path the Timekeepers created - its the creation of **Nexus Events**. A Nexus Event being something that, if left unchecked, could lead into another multiversal war.  \\n\\n\\nWe can presume that Loki escaping with the Tesseract in Avengers; End Game was a Nexus Event, while other sources of time travel - such as the Avengers getting the infinity stones in Endgame and Doctor Strange\\'s time loop in his movie are \\'closed loops\\' and thus are not Nexus events.  \\n\\n\\nI imagine the main reason people feel this way is that Loki, the character, is of the mind that this \"is\" a infringement of all free will. I imagine we will figure out if this is the case or not over the course of the six episodes of the show, but with the evidence we have now I feel that it is relatively unlikely.  \\n\\n\\n&gt;**2.** **That \"The infinity stones in the drawer of the office worker marginalizes the events of Endgame, WandaVision and Infinity War by making the sacrifices those characters made less important.\"**\\n\\nThe main reason people come to this conclusion is due to how important the MCU has made the Infinity Stones, and just \"having a unlimited supply of them\" creates an issue where things like Black Widow\\'s sacrifice, the militarized White Vision in WandaVision and even Loki\\'s death in Infinity War less impactful.  \\n\\n\\nI have seen a common rebuttal to this, being that the Infinity Stones in that drawer no longer work, due to the fact that they are from other timelines from the main timeline.  \\nI feel like that specific counter argument hits a bit of a snag when you consider the events of Endgame, where the whole plot is getting another timelines Infinity Stones to use in a different timeline, this contradicting the common support for this plot point.  \\n\\n\\nI feel that a way to explain this could be that those infinity stones are from \"Reset\" timelines, and that the act of resetting a timeline actually destroys ( \"Melts\" ) it, so any infinity stones from that reset timeline are essentially deprived of power, but that feels more like a theory to ensure that Endgame and Loki don\\'t contradict each other, rather then pure authorial intent.  \\nWe will probably, in time, see further explanation to this point to remedy any confusion concerning this point - although I very well could be wrong.  \\n\\n\\n&gt;**3. That \"It doesn\\'t make sense that the TVA is so human focused. Why are there only humans here? Why is it a 70\\'s Aesthetic?\"**\\n\\nThis point is pretty easy to solve, in Miss Minutes introduction video you can see the earth in the background, which very well could imply that every planet has their own local TVA office. The actual aesthetic may be related to the time when this local TVA office was formed, but we don\\'t have enough evidence to make any calls yet.  \\n\\n\\n**TL;DR: Overall, I think we should wait and give Loki some time before assuming that the show\\'s framing of the MCU is damaging to the entirety of the setting. I think we should give the show a bit of time and see how it looks by the end of its run before coming to such conclusions.**',\n",

I wonder if you actually need an \"outside\" force to pull you off the path you were always supposed to take.  For our Loki the Evil Loki was that outside force.  The TVA said the heist for the Tesseract in 2012 was supposed to happen how it did except that Loki should not have gotten the cube.  Maybe when Hulk hit Tony the Tesseract was only supposed to fly say ten feet away but Evil Loki was there secretly to give it a little push another few feet so our Loki could get his hands on it.

This changed him already because now he knows what he has to do and he knows it's the right thing to do because he saw his future self do it. He also saw himself and his mother, Frigga die, and this made him cry. He  felt so guilty when Agent Mobius said he basically killed his mother and he felt terrified when he saw Thanos in the future because his future self looked so scared. Now that 2012 Loki knows what's coming, he might make a few adjustments to the timeline. I think this show will be about him going to different periods of time with the TVA to try and stop Loki from the future or Loki from another multiverse from changing the sacred timeline and killing all the minutemen. Then, after he completes his mission, he'll start his real mission. After Agent Mobius sets him free and allows him to go back to his time, he will probably save his mother and probably not go against the titan himself, Thanos which will change the sacred timeline and create multiple timelines in the same universe.

I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm down to join Loki and help him burn the TVA down to the ground and then hold each others' penises while we piss on the ashes. \\n\\nWhat really makes this for me is Loki's moment of humanity. Yes, he's capable of emotion - jealousy, loss, grief, love - all of that is visible throughout the MCU and this episode. But through all of this, him (and Thor) have thought of themselves as gods, as superior beings that have the strength to shape reality and the universe. Benevolent gods, but gods - something Loki tells Thanos he'll never be. \\n\\nAnd then he's told, without mercy, that every decision and every moment of his life has been foretold, that he's been dancing to the tune of a superior power, that he has never had even the semblance of a choice throughout hai - glorious - life. In that instant, Loki's divinity is shattered, and *that*, for me is when he's at his most human. Gods don't get jerked around by higher powers. Gods don't live their lives by the rules of other beings. Gods aren't trapped in a cage where they're dictated every second of their miserable existence, no matter how pathetic, by someone else. That's for lesser beings. For humans. \\n\\nDeterminism vs Free Will is an age old debate. The idea that my choices are meaningless, or already predestined ignites something angry inside me, something rebellious and shaking. Would I rather the comfort of knowing my path is set, for better and worse, for good or bad, and find spirituality in the faith of this higher power? Or would I countenance the terrible idea that my choices are my own, that no one is looking out for me, that my path is my own, without that benevolent hand guiding me when I fall? I'd pick the latter. Humanity, in its best moments, hasn't rolled over. It hasn't shown it's belly. We're defined by our ability to question the unknown, to stand on the edge of darkness and scream into the void, to not go gentle into that good night, to rage and rage against the dying light. \\n\\nAnd that, for me, is the hook in Loki. Loki realizes his 'humanity' not through love, or kinship, or redemption. He realizes it through his rebellion against the fact that his life is pre-ordained by a higher power he can never see. The levels of thought that has gone into the writing chills me to my bone - the idea that they can take something that's marketed as popcorn entertainment, and run through it such visceral, universal themes. \\n\\nI want Loki to *annihilate* the TVA and the timekeepers.

Loki goes down to see him and gloat, and as he does so is visited by the spirit of Balder, his and Thor\\'s other brother whose death Loki engineered long ago. Balder tells Loki that he knows he\\'s going to lose, because during his journey in the afterlife he saw that there are tons of parallel dimensions (the multiverse) each with versions of themselves, and while some details or their looks may be different in some of them, *their roles always stay the same, and Loki\\'s is never to rule.*\\n\\nThis is just like in the first episode of the series, fittingly titled \"Glorious Purpose\", where Loki believes he\\'s destined to be King of Earth and Asgard and rule the cosmos as this great liberator while Mobius is effectively playing the role of Balder and chipping away at the perception, asking Loki why he always loses in the end if he\\'s meant to rule as he says before showing him footage of his future where he doesn\\'t end up as the great King he thought he would be. Just as Balder tells Loki in the comics that the roles are always the same and he\\'s never meant to rule, Mobius tells MCU Loki that the future fate he saw happens \"over and over and over again\" across the multiverse as \"that\\'s the natural flow of time\". Mobius\\' lines about Loki existing to cause pain and misery and death while ensuring others can become the best versions of themselves are also eerily similar to Balder\\'s \\'never meant to rule\\' jibe.\\n\\nSo all in all, at the very least you can see the similarities and potential inspiration!

Then I imagined a Loki spoof of [Superjail's intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvSHhm6R7dQ), which totally fits. \\n\\nIf you have never seen Superjail, it always opens with this belligerent criminal getting his ass kicked by Jailbot before being flown off to an interdimensional prison called Superjail. Along the way, they pass through bizarre landscapes full of strange sights. I highly recommend you watch the intro on YouTube, the intro always changes each episode. It's a work of art.\\n\\nI want to recreate this, but from Loki's point of view. I need animators to create segments of the bizarre landscapes, except these will be Marvel multiverse shenanigans. You can picture whatever you want, and render however you want it. Do you want to show the X-Men riding a rollercoaster in a Sentinel theme park, in pixel art? Do you want to show the Guardians of the Galaxy playing Dance Dance Revolution, in claymation? Go wild, but not super NSFW! Bear in mind, the landscapes appear only at the bottom half of the screen, so it won't take up the entire screen and will be tiny!\\n\\nThere are eight landscapes in every Superjail intro, appearing on screen each for a total of five seconds. So I'm seeking eight animators to create five seconds of their own unique, bizarre Marvel-related scenarios. I'll be animating Loki being carried off by the robot, Moebius' face forming out of clouds and swallowing Loki and the robot, the TVA appearing at the end, and other interstitial animations. \\n\\nI will definitely be paying animators for their time. I have a budget in mind and a fixed fee that I will propose to each interested animator. I think this is a wild concept and I'd like to see it done. If you are an animator, or know any animators, and are a Marvel fan, and want to be part of this kooky project, hit me up on my Reddit DM and we can go from there.

       "       'I haven\\'t seen this theory anywhere before, so forgive me if the moment of clarity I had last night while thinking about this show and, specifically, its depiction of time travel and Everett and Schrodinger\\'s Many Worlds Theory, is in fact well-known at this stage. However, I\\'m confident I may have predicted the ending to *Loki*, or at least one of its beats*.* And by ending, I mean the narrative resolution to the set-ups and textual expansion we saw in Episode 1. Naturally, a lot can change here, and I\\'m only going off approximately 50 minutes of a six-hour series, so I could be way off.\\n\\nIf I\\'m right, then there a lot of hints, set-ups and dramatic irony seeded in a lot of Loki and Mobius\\' conversations at the beginning and ending of Episode 1. Additionally, having Loki view his entire lifetime at the TVA Time Theatre, from his imprisonment in Asgard to his death by Thanos will revise Loki\\'s character arc as one that is particularly poignant, borderline tragic, and immensely selfless.\\n\\n**The theory**\\n\\nIn short, I believe that Loki\\'s narrative doesn\\'t canonically end when the series ends but it will be the last we see of him. As part of the journey he embarks on with Mobius M. Mobius and Hunter B-15 to thwart the villain responsible for killing the Minute Men, he will in fact realise that his place in the Sacred Timeline is precisely where he departed it - the Avengers Tower lobby in 2012, minutes after the end of the Battle of New York. Shorter still, Loki will return to Avengers Tower at the end of the series and live out the rest of his character\\'s canonical experiences from 2012-2019, right up until Thanos kills him, *knowing his fate*, since he has seen it all happen before*.*\\n\\n**The Sacred Timeline must be preserved**\\n\\nIf we are to believe the TVA\\'s dedication to preserving a \"Sacred Timeline\"  (and I realise many theories question the legitimacy of the TVA and the propaganda-esque vibe of characters like the Time Keepers and Miss Minutes), then that means that the timeline we are now in is a branch timeline. It was created by Loki\\'s 2012 escape, similar to what happens in *Donnie Darko* (2001) and *Primer* (2004), but it feels like this series most closely matches the world-structure of the exceptionally good Netflix original *Dark* (2017): it is a timeline that *cannot* be sustained and will eventually be destroyed (by whose hand, it is as yet unclear). As with *Dark*, the only way to close this time loop (or clip this branch timeline, to use TVA jargon) is to remove the Variant that birthed it from it. The TVA call this process \"resetting,\" which presumably returns the \"reset\" Variant to the point where they left their native timeline.\\n\\nMobius says it himself - the events Loki sees in the Time Theatre that \"never even happened\" (Loki, *Loki* Episode 1, 30:52) simply haven\\'t happened to him \"yet,\" (Mobius, *Loki* Episode 1, 30:58). Later on, Mobius says he cannot \"offer \\\\[Loki\\\\] salvation,\" (Mobius, *Loki* Episode 1, 43:25) because Loki has a pre-destined path that even he cannot outmanoeuvre. That path ends with Thanos in 2019.\\n\\nSo its clear that the rules of the game are set - if the Sacred Timeline *must* be preserved, there is only one place that Loki can go - he *must* return to his timeline to allow the events of the MCU to play out as they have already.\\n\\nN.B. While it is likely a Nexus Event may cause the fabric of the Sacred Timeline to eventually break apart (given what we know of *Spider-Man: Now Way Home* and *Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness*), Loki is killed in 2019, so the Loki we know cannot possibly live beyond that point in time for that Universe.\\n\\n**Mobius is using Loki**\\n\\nOwen Wilson being cast as Mobius is a stroke of genius because it will throw viewers of the scent of his true intentions. He\\'s far from a villain, but in his first scene, he is shown to be intellectual, empathetic and contemplative, in spite of his apparently goofy presentation in the trailers and some quieter moments between him and Loki. While he is still clearly an ally to Loki, he is still a servant of the TVA before anyone or anything else.\\n\\nI suspect Mobius is serving a similar narrative purpose as Jon Hamm\\'s character in the *Black Mirror* episode *White Christmas* (2014). His plan is to use Loki to clear up the Nexus Events/reset the Variants his 2012 escape caused/unleashed in the Sacred Timeline, and will then ask him (or somehow otherwise convince/force him) to return to that exact time to live out the rest of his days, in full knowledge of the end of his path.\\n\\nNotice how, when a dejected, despondent and grieving Loki says \"I can\\'t go back, can I? Back to my timeline,\" (Loki, *Loki* Episode 1, 42:05), Mobius looks at him but never answers. However, *this* Loki is 2012 Loki, an arrogant, devious trickster who, even after being shown the ultimate futility of the Infinity Stones, would never volunteer to live out a timeline where he is responsible for his mother\\'s death. I suspect, at the end of the series, Mobius will still expect Loki to resist, but he will have undergone enough character growth across the series to eventually make the decision to return to 2012 *of his own volition*, thus completing his character arc.\\n\\n**Poignant and ironic**\\n\\nThis is a particularly poignant inevitability. Loki has always been able to escape - that\\'s who he is. He ultimately made an unexpected escape in *Thor* (2011), *Avengers* (2012, *Endgame* narrative)), *Thor: The Dark World* (2013) and in *Thor: Ragnarok* (2017), but since he dies in 2019, that is his predestined path in the Sacred Timeline.\\n\\nIt is particularly ironic in the beginning of the episode that Loki exclaims that \"This is a mistake! I shouldn\\'t be here!\" (Loki, *Loki* Episode 1, 09:15), because he is precisely where the TVA needs him in order to restore the Sacred Timeline. Furthermore, \"You ridiculous bureaucrats will not dictate how my story ends!\" (Loki, *Loki* Episode 1, 17:42) and yet, his story in the MCU Universe has already ended and it is these \"ridiculous bureaucrats\" who must dictate that he return to his timeline. Now, he can only hope the redeem himself by being useful to the TVA and by then returning to his pre-destined path.\\n\\n**A final thought on determinism**\\n\\nBy the end of Episode 1, Loki is already learning more about the \"formidable\" TVA and how small he is in the vastness of the Universe. He goes from ridiculing Mobius\\' question about enjoying hurting people (I think he refuses to answer/acknowledge) to quietly admitting \"I don\\'t enjoying hurting people \\\\[...\\\\] I do it because I have to\" (Loki, *Loki* Episode 1, 42:20). He is already accepting he has a pre-destined role to play and only the illusion of free will, and thus foreshadowing the ultimate sacrifice he will make by returning to 2012 to face imprisonment, to indirectly cause the death of his mother, the bring about Ragnarok and destroy Asgard and to finally, unsuccessfully, attempt to kill Thanos in 2019.\\n\\n**Tl;dr:**\\n\\nLoki died in 2019 and nothing Variant Loki can do will change that. He will end the series by choosing to return to the Avengers Tower lobby in 2012 at the precise point in time that he disappeared, much to the surprise of Thor and the rest of the Avengers, and quietly live the rest of his canonical life in full awareness of his future actions, their ramifications, and the exact moment and means by which he is killed.',\n",

The villains would be Whirlwind at the beginning of the movie, but the main primary villains would be Egghead and Nathan Garrett/Black Knight I, and at the final battle of the film, Scarlet Beetle as the big CGI boss villain. Two big plot points would be Hank trying to grow above 12 feet as Giant Man since he can’t find the right calibrations to set his belt to actually survive growing bigger. Until he finally sets his belt calibrations to 27-62 (referencing his first appearance) to grow to 50 feet to fight Scarlet Beetle. Another important plot point would be the relationship between Hank and Janet, as Hank kinda neglects Janet and ignores her romantic and sexual advances, only focused on his work and fighting crime. By the end, he finally confesses his love for Janet, apologizing for the way he has treated her. That’s all I have so far, let me know what you guys think of this concept.',\n",

       "       '&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSo first of, this is a theory. If any part of what I am about to write has already been confirmed or officially denied, I don´t know that, I don´t really keep up with the speculations and rumors. But from the first episode of Loki, i have a couple of, what I believe to be, intersting theories.\\n\\nThe Premise:\\n\\nThe TVA will be destroyed/dismantled etc.:\\n\\nSo from what I´ve gathered during the first episode of Loki, it appears, that we have two Lokis on our hands. Our 2012 protagonist Loki, who this series revolves around, and the \"Loki\" at the end of the first episode, who is commiting crimes against the timeline, which results in the main timeline getting potentially split up into a multiverse, as the informational video during the ticket scene explained, and the TVA hunting him down. Now i believe that this season we will see 2012 Loki trying to undo all those crimes against the timeline, which the other Loki committed/is commiting, in order to protect the timeline and redeem ihmself. Now I believe that while the \"Other Loki\" might be apprehended in the end, the damage he caused to the timeline will already be too grand, therefore causing the formation of a multiverse and setting the road for Dr.Strange: Multiverse of madness and Antman and the Wasp:Quantumania, among others.\\n\\nNow the emergence of this multiverse will have some effect on the TVA. Maybe it gets destroyed throughout the show, maybe the existence of multiple timelines makes the existence of an agency, which only protects a singular strain of time, obsolete and it gets dismanteled, depowered or \"nerfed\" but I believe, that some fundamental shift of power, towards the worse of the TVA, will occur.\\n\\nThis, I believe, will have consequences for Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, Antman and the Wasp: Quantumania and possibly even other upcoming MCU projects. Below I have listed some possibilities, of how this could work out.\\n\\n1. Nightmare:\\n\\nWhen Loki gets a look at the \"TVA-City\" for the first time, he says: \"This is a nightmare.\" To which Mobius replies: \"No, that´s a whole other department.\" I believe that this departement controls the dreams (and therefore nightmares) of sentient beings, or Humans at the very least. Now if a being like nightmare - who, to my knowledge, has already been confirmed to be the main villain in Dr. Strange 2 - commits crimes against the order of dreams, just like Loki commits crimes against the order of time, it would make perfect sense to me, that this department (of the TVA?) would use its resources to apprehend this being. And if that were the case, the collapse of such an institution could mean, that this being is released to the multiverse, or the main universe of the MCU because the existence of a multiverse doesn´t necessarily mean, that he can travel it freely.\\n\\nThis would mean, that at this point, nightmare is being held by the TVA and gets released when the TVA collapses. They might have even captured him, in order to harness his powers to control dreams in the first place.\\n\\n2. Kang\\n\\nKang is a time keeper and part of the TVA. I´m not to familiar with Kang in the comics, but even I know, that time travel is kinda his thig. I believe, that he is a timekeeper, specificially the leader of the TVA and the whole society, the seem to be bound to. According to my theory, the end of Loki will see the fall of this empire, for which he might want revenge. He wants revenge on earth, for breaking the timeline and especially on Ant-Man (and the Wasp) for bringing earth the technology needed, to break the timeline in the first place. So he wants to exert revenge by caputring earth (other worlds might follow, he´s a conqueror, after all). He might also have been conquering worlds, in order to acquire resources like weapons and technology, to prepare for his conquest of earth.\\n\\n3. Spiderman, into the Spiderverse and Spiderman: No Way Home\\n\\nNow I actually just thought of this, as i was writing the theory above, but bear with me:\\n\\nWhat if a particle accelerator like the one, that Kingpin used, had the potential to access different universes, or, by definition, different timelines within the universe? That means, that as long as there is only one singular, TVA protected timeline, this potential can not unfold, because there simply are no other timelines to access. Particle accelerators would the \"only\" do what they say: accelerate particles.\\n\\nThis also means that, as soon as the main timeline starts to split even ONCE, particle accelerators might be used for interdimensional travel, like we at least fundamentally see in Into The SpiderVerse and that this technology would hypothetically allow for Spiderman: No Way Home to become the multiversal fan-fest, that everyone wants it to be.\\n\\n4. When does the Multiverse come to existence?\\n\\nNow all of this poses the intersting question, \"When did the timeline break?\" and naturally and logically, you would assume the first time the \"other Loki\" breaks the timeline irreversibly wight be the point in the main timeline, from which all timelines spring, but I believe there´s more:\\n\\nWhen he presents him the \"Highlights of his life\" Mobius tells Loki that \"This is how it´s supposed to go, over and over and over again!\"\\n\\nNow this could mean that this timeline loops infinetly often. But what does it loop around? Time has neither a beginning nor an end, so when would the loop begin and end? Furthermore if the whole timeline repeats and resets itself voluntarily already, the existence of an institution, such as the TVA would become obsolete and everything that´s happening in the MCU less intersting, if you ask me.\\n\\nI think that a timeline like the MCU happens infinetly often, somewhat simultaneously, shifted by an infinite amount of times, relative to the MCU timeline. What I mean by this is that a new timeline/universe is being born constantly, shifted temporarily by an infinite amont of times, so basically we could have an universe, which might be one milion years behind the MCU, while another is only an attosecond of. Think of it like the one episode of Rick and Morty, with the \"save point Remote\", but branched out infinetly. If Thanos snaps in the main universe, he might also snap in the other universes, but never at the EXACT same time. This would open up the whole possibility of the multiverse, because if we regard the initial destruction of the TVA in the main MCU timeline as a fixed point in time ACROSS ALL UNIVERSES, then all universes born after that initial destruction are constantly branching out from the very beginning of their existence (never hindered by the TVA), while those born before the initial branching of are only starting to branch out from the point in time, which is equal to the initial breaking in the main MCU. So basically when a theorethical universe was born an hour before the Loki timeline which we are observing now, it´s starting to branch out simultaneously to the MCU, but since it is an hour \"older\" it´s like it´s branching out later than the MCU',\n",

We know now that the multiverse has been condensed into one “sacred timeline”. It is only a matter of time before before the Loki variant or some other force unravels this timeline resulting in a rebirth of the multiverse. For this reason I believe Marvel and Sony are holding off on dropping the NWH trailer until after this event occurs in Loki. What do you all think about this?',\n",

But when I thought about it further, I ended up finding another reason upon rewatches.\\n\\nFrom the exact moment he got stabbed, that wasn't Superman screaming. Because the Kryptonite spear took away his invulnerability. **That was Clark Kent.** A journalist who sought the truth in a more paranoid world. A humble man who found happiness with a woman he loved and the parents who raised him.

After Superman II when Clark erased Lois mind and backtracked their relationship, I was hoping to see it rebuild this movie. Was the actress busy filming another movie or something because her role was so incredibly small. \\n\\nAlso is Lana going to be the new love interest in Superman IV? The movie seems to set Clark and Lana up as a potential couple?\\n\\nGus was just so incredibly smart for some reason and it was never really explained. Gus was portrayed to be an ordinary guy at the beginning but all of sudden becomes a 1000 iq hacker? The dude could just casually blueprinted the world’s most advance supercomputer in a few weeks but is struggling to find employment?\\n\\nAlso, the logic in this movie was ridiculous. If you could just hack good enough, a satellite designed to monitor weather will be able to control it instead. I know it’s a superhero movie but the first Superman movie was reasonable enough for me to believe.\\n\\nThe main villain was forgettable and a discount Hackman.\\n\\nFinally, this movie literally pulled a reverse-WW84. The villains managed to change Superman’s personality and one of them seduced Superman and convinces him to rip a hole in an oil tanker. After that, she fucks Superman and later in the film, Superman seems to have no recollection of this at all and implies that evil Superman was a separate personality. That was a huge wtf moment for me.\\n\\nNext sure if I should watch Superman IV. Will Lois have more screen time next film?

The League of Shadows built up their cause by infecting Gotham from the inside- their foundation underneath Wayne Enterprises (also through Talia working undercover as Miranda Tate so she knew where Bruce\\'s armory and reactor was), and indoctrinating a lot of the needy and desperate- those who were \"cast out into the cold world that we know and endure\". They gradually rise up from the underground and trade places on the surface with the Gotham City police- those who were seen as oppressors due to The Dent Act end up underground, then they eventually rise back out and take back Gotham.

       "       'Ever since it was announced I’ve been wondering how exactly a single animated movie would work for injustice. Cause there’s so much to cover. There’s 2 games. About 192 comic issues explaining the first first game alone. 36 issues set between the first and second game. And a cross over/sequel to the second game involving masters of the universe.\\n\\nThat’s just too much source material for 1 movie. Unless it only covers the first game. Which it probably will. But it’ll have some plot holes to people unaware of the story. The comic story also follows 5 years. And I don’t think you can fit more then 1 year in a movie.\\n\\nSo this is how I would do it:\\n\\nMovie 1: ground zero comic\\n\\nMovie 2: comics year 1\\n\\nMovie 3: comics year 2\\n\\nMovie 4: comics year 3\\n\\nMovie 5: comics year 4\\n\\nMovie 6: comics year 5\\n\\nMovie 7: first game \\n\\nMovie 8: injustice 2 comics \\n\\nMovie 9 injustice 2 game \\n\\nMovie 10: injustice vs masters of the universe\\n\\nThere’s also year zero comics but I’m not really sure where they take place in the story.

Nothing really stood out as good or as bad but it was all just ok.  7/10\\n\\n5: Man of Steel: I feel similar about it to Wonder Woman but I think MOS has a killer soundtrack and Henry Cavil was born to play Superman. A little too dark and hopeless for me for a Superman movie, but for what they were going for, I like it. 7/10\\n\\n4: Batman v. Superman: When I first watched it I hated it. Then I watched the directors cut and I liked it a lot better. I honestly love Affleck as Batman. Jesse Eisenberg was awful as Lex Luther though. The visuals are cool and the action is fantastic. I think the Martha scene is great and makes perfect sense. Also my favorite DCEU soundtrack. 7.2/10\\n\\n3: WW84: I think it’s already very underrated. If you ignore logic for a while it’s fun and has some of my all time favorite DCEU moments. All of the actors are great. The themes about truth are fitting. My favorite visuals of the franchise (watch it in 4K if you can). I really love it and if they cut a bit from the fight scene with Cheetah at the end and explained more about how the wishes worked it would be a #2. 8/10\\n\\n2: Shazam: There’s nothing really wrong with this movie. The actors are great, even the kids. Zachary Levi is incredible as the title character. Has hope and optimism that not a lot of DC films have. 9/10\\n\\n1: Zack Snyder’s Justice League: This is everything I want a comic book blockbuster to be. Incredibly epic and intense throughout but has it’s quieter moments too. Very well paced for the most part. Would love to see it in IMAX. My only complaint is that the epilogue drags on and is unnecessary, since we probably won’t get sequels. 9.8/10',\n",

       "       \"I love the comic series by Tim Seeley and Tom King, and after I finished all 5 vols, I always thought it would make a banger of a TV series. For those who are unaware, Nightwing fakes his death after his identity is outed to the public, and becomes a super-spy, working for a clandestine organisation called SPYRAL, while also being a mole for Batman. Obviously we'll have to change a few things, like the entire Batman not knowing Grayson's still alive thing, but the core concept of a Spy-thriller starring the boy wonder all grown up, filled with action, intrigue, double-crossing and a heap of cool-ass gadgets? What's not to love?\\n\\nIt can be set in the DCEU Main (Or Snyderverse, whichever one's gonna be canon by the time this ever gets made)\\n\\nSo Zack said that the dead robin spoken of in BvS and ZSJL is supposed to be Dick Grayson, right? I know it's not official or anything but he said it was a headcanon of his, so let's work with that. Since we don't know the exact circumstances regarding his death, except for the Joker's involvement, we have a lot of creative leeway.\\n\\nDick and Bruce are arguing over how much good batman really does, and if he even needs a robin anymore. This leads to Dick wanting to do more than just be robin, and instead forge his own identity.\\n\\nFor the actual death, we can present a mashup of Jason Todd's death from *A death in the Family* and Dick Grayson's supposed death in *Forever Evil.* \\n\\nLet's say he faked his death. Not an elaborate plan or a ruse or anything, but he managed to survive a beating from the Joker by the skin of his teeth, and also escapes the warehouse before it blows up. He manages to slip away, aided by none other than Alfred, who's the only one who sympathises with Dick's plan to leave the costumed career behind. This then becomes the origin story of Agent 37, the best agent S.P.Y.R.A.L ever had. \\n\\nAs to why Dick joined SPYRAL, he thought he could do more good without being tied down to Gotham and being allowed to play by his own rules for once. \\n\\nThe main conflict of the show can be him unravelling a conspiracy by the very organisation he's working for, in an *Enemy of the state* or *Snowden* kind of way. I haven't really decided what the conspiracy should be yet, but there's definitely loads to pick from the comics.\\n\\nThe comic also had Grayson, the lovable former robin, teamed up with a no-nonsense, by-the-book senior agent called Tiger, and on-screen the buddy cop dynamic would work brilliantly. The rest of the book also has an incredible story involving recovering stolen tech and a Cold War against the other big DC spy organisation, Checkmate. I don't want to spoil any of the details because the comic is an absolute must-read. \\n\\nThe main characters in the story would be:\\n\\nDick Grayson, obviously.\\n\\nAgent One a.k.a Tiger. A mysterious Senior agent who loves to hate Dick, and scrutanizes everything he does.\\n\\nHelena Bertinelli. After leaving the Birds of Prey, she joins SPYRAL and quickly climbs the ranks to become their deadliest assassin, and often ends up butting heads with Dick over how to handle situations. In the books she was used as an on-again-off-again love interest, so maybe the same could happen here. \\n\\nThe main villain as Mr. Minos, the faceless head of SPYRAL, who has a particular fondness for Grayson that Dick exploits to unravel the conspiracy\\n\\nSince Dick Grayson's a grounded character, there wouldn't be a requirement of a GoT size budget, but with a decent sized bankable from HBO, they could ensure that the production quality, cinematography, action scenes and writing are all of the highest calibre. \\n\\nDo let me know what you think of this, and if you'd like to add or change anything. I haven't really thought of the casting yet, but I think Tyler Posey (Teen Wolf) looks quite good for the part of Grayson.\",\n",

       "       '**The Justice League**: The Creation of The Justice League, Which consists of Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, The Flash (Wally West), Green Lantern (John Stewart), Martian Manhunter and Aquaman, Teaming up together to fight DARKSEID, At The end they defeat him but This is not the last time that they will see him, The Plot of this film is very similar to the plot of Justice League: War.\\n\\n**The Batman**: The plot of this film will be about Deathstroke going on a revenge journey to kill The Batman because The Batman is responsible for the death of his family, They have a big fight at the end, Similar to the Arkham Origins fight, Deathstroke escapes at the end, So, We could use him again in another film.\\n\\n**Wonder Woman**: This film is really similar to Wonder Woman 1984, It will have Maxwell Lord and Cheetah as The Villains, Maxwell Lord also uses the Dream stone but it will be more fleshed out, Explaining it\\'s origins and have clear roles and not like how they did it in WW84, Cheetah is not Cheetah until the end of the film, Where she fully transforms into her classical form, This film will be more of a political drama, talking about The lies of the government, as they want Wonder Woman to be a kind of a government symbol, Maxwell Lord escapes at the end, So does Cheetah, Because we need them in other films. \\n\\n**Martian Manhunter**: This film will be an origin story for Martian Manhunter (Obviously), Exploring where he came from like how they did with Krypton in Man Of Steel, and When he arrives to earth we will see his struggles with trying to blend in with humans, Not knowing his purpose, It will be a character study film, it will not have a villain, It\\'s just a Pretty good superhero flick exploring Martian Manhunter\\'s character and him working in the government, Trying to protect the world without them knowing, and at the end, When superheroes starts appearing to the world, This will grab his Attention, Which will courage him to reveal himself to the world as Martian Manhunter, Publicly Saving People, and Him becoming The Martian Manhunter.\\n\\n**Aquaman**: Basically, The 2018\\'s Aquaman, No changes at all. \\n\\n**Green Lantern Corps**: This film will not be an origin story for One Lantern, But it will tell the history of the Green Lantern and their history with the other lanterns, and Their story to the modern day, How John Stewart joined them and Many other new lanterns. \\n\\n**The Flash**: I really don\\'t have many ideas for this one, My only ideas are Barry is investigating in his mother\\'s murder, While fighting Captain Cold (Leonard Snart), Who is out of prison, Barry and Iris are slowly becoming together, at near the end of the second act, Barry accidentally travels back in time to his mother\\'s murder day, and He finds out that a speedster killed his mother, after the accident while his mother is dying, He is an emotional scene with her revealing his identity to her, Telling her that he is okay and so on, then he goes to the present day, Fights Captain Cold, Locks Him in prison and saves the day, and at the end of the film Barry gets a new suit, and as a post-credit scene, Snart is in prison, and someone mysterious behind bars comes to him and say (Would like to have the opportunity to defeat The Flash?), and then it reveals that the person behinds the bars is… Maxwell Lord, The film ends \\n\\n**The Justice League vs. The Legion Of Doom**: The film is about The Justice League against The Legion Of Doom, Which Consists of (Maxwell Lord \"Leader\", Cheetah, Deathstroke, Clayface, Black Manta, Sinistro, Bizarro), The plot of this film is really similar to the cancelled George Miller\\'s film, Justice League: Mortal, Maxwell Lord is going to use Batman\\'s contingency plan against The Justice League, Wonder Woman vs Cheetah, Batman vs Deathstroke, Superman vs Bizarro, Aquaman vs Black Manta, John Stewart vs Sinistro, and Martian Manhunter is going to be tricked by a former agent he met in his Government times, but she will turn out to be Clayface, He has put a Venom in his drink, So Martian Manhunter is now on fire and Clayface is still fighting him, Every member of the league fights their own enemy, Except Superman and Batman, Who doesn\\'t Know about anything until Alfred tells him about the grave of his parents, he goes there he finds the that the grave of his parents is not there, he is worried but then all of a sudden, The Wayne Manor is exploded, Batman Rushes to save Alfred, He saves him, and goes with him to The Batcave, Which is under the manor, Bruce watch the other members in the tv, He puts on his suit, goes out, only to find Deathstroke waiting for him to start the fight, Bruce is angry and he starts fighting, Superman knows about the emergency, Rushes to the save the league but out of nowhere, Bizarro reveals himself and starts fighting superman, at the of the film Batman defeats Deathstroke, and Reports the team about how to defeats the others, They win, and Finds Maxwell Lord in a Kryptonian ship (Which is one of Superman\\'s Ships, when he came to earth), With a weird glowing box. and there is a hologram of STEPPENWOLF, They arrest him, but he is confident, at the end, There is a meeting between The Justice League about whether Batman should stay or not, but Batman quits Himself, and The film ends.\\n\\n**Man Of Tomorrow**: I also don\\'t have many ideas for this, but some of my ideas are that Brainiac is The villain, Clark and Lois are planning to get married, Some fighting happens and so on, At the end Clark and Lois get Married, and the film ends.\\n\\n**New Gods**: I don\\'t know many things about The New Gods comics, But this film\\'s purpose is to Introduce us to Darkseid Origin and his history with Steppenwolf, and then at the end of the film, We go to the present day, Steppenwolf comes to Darkseid, Saying to him that they found the Motherboxes.\\n\\n**The Justice League: No Justice Part 1/2** :- The third installment is going to be in two parts, With the title \"No Justice\", These two films are going with the original plan of \"Zack Snyder\" for The DCEU, Lois is Pregnant with Clark\\'s child, in the first part, Steppenwolf will go against The Justice League, Batman will team up with The Justice League, at least temporary, at the last 15 minutes they kill Steppenwolf, but then a portal from Apokolips with Darkseid with an army of ships, While The Justice League are Fighting The Apokolips\\' Army, Darkseid teleports to the Batcave (Where Lois is staying for protection) and kills Lois with her child, Superman is devastated, Darkseid uses The Anti-Life Equation to make Superman evil, While The league is fighting, Darkseid comes in and Superman appears behind him with his eyes flaming, and now Five Years Later is the left members of the league are in the desert at night, Batman says (Let\\'s go inside before he comes) and End Part One, Part Two is the same as Snyder Planed but Exclude The Lois child is Bruce\\'s, Because that is the worst part of the plan, and Yes, Batman dies at the end sacrificing himself for the universe and The League continues the Mission, at the end, There is a Funeral for Batman, and The Film Ends, So Does this universe.\\n\\nWhat do you think of this plan?

       "       'So today I had an enlightening conversation with a guy who called me a  \"dumpster fire\", a \"fucking phoney\", a \"fraud of a movie goer\", and suggested that I \"go watch planet of the chimps and spank my flabby monkey\". The reason was that I didn\\'t like Snyder\\'s superman. \\n\\nBear with me, this is not some pity-party calling out, because despite all the colourful language that he used, he did make a valid point.\\n\\nI had a plethora of reasons for why I didn\\'t like Snyder\\'s superman (which I could get into if you ask me but I don\\'t really think they\\'re gonna be relevant to this), but all of it boiled down to the fact that I just didn\\'t feel inspired by the character, as he felt too much a reluctant hero and too angsty for me. To me it was like going against the very core of what made superman great, someone who always had hope and love no matter how dire the world around him was.\\n\\nAt this point in our conversation I had been called all sorts of names, so I didn\\'t expect much. However, what he told me really got me thinking.\\n\\nHe said that this superman was hated by everyone, the media, lex, bats, but the love of one person was enough for him to die for them. He said that he\\'s a superman for kids with bad homes, a man who would do the right thing despite feeling like it\\'s a lost cause, and that this was the superman that made him feel better.\\n\\nI stopped for a second there. \\n\\nI never actually considered what someone going through those circumstances would see, and that this superman could possibly inspire someone who had no reason to believe in a better future.\\n\\nAnd then I stopped for another second, and realised something.\\n\\nThe core of Superman, which I so vehemently wanted upheld ironically, is to inspire in the darkest of times, to shine a light to those who seem like all is lost. In my attempt to discredit someone else\\'s idea of superman, I realised that I was going against the very morals that I believed superman upheld. I felt bad. Maybe I was wrong.\\n\\nEventually we did agree upon something, that ZSJL had a closer to home supes, and that by the end of Snyder\\'s movies (if they ever happen) all would be as I would have wanted.\\n\\nThere\\'s other superman portrayals that I\\'ve connected with more, inspired me and given me hope, and if Snyder\\'s version could do that for someone, then it seems he\\'s done his job well. \\n\\nI don\\'t know if Snyder\\'s version will ever be for me, but actually understanding how he could be the one for someone else made me realise that there\\'s no point in disliking any of the versions, be it Cavill, Cain, Reeves or Hoechlin.\\n\\nWhatever qualms we may have with the portrayal, as long as they\\'ve inspired someone, anyone at all, they\\'re all the true superman in my books now.\\n\\nP.S I still think attacking someone for a diff opinion, as in name calling, is still wrong, even if you have a valid point.',\n",

       "       \"Spoiler for MoS and BvS\\n\\nI often see this topic broached every few years, and is getting somewhat of a revival recently, but I don't see a lot of people talking about Man of Steel in terms of its narrative framing. What I mean by that is how the film wants you to see certain things, as bad or good or neutral. When Pa Kent tells Clark that it would have been better to let those kids die, the narrative wants to tell you that this is the right call, further validated by his avoidable death.\\n\\nThat this is his characterization would be fine if it wasn't simultaneously relying on the image people of Superman in pop culture to sanitize the same character. The Clark in Man of Steel is callous to say the least. Realistically speaking, people in Superman's world would not like him. Yet, aside from making the military grumpy, there is very little backlash to Superman and the lesson his parents taught him are framed as being right in the end. There he stands, making out with Lois on top of what used to be Metropolis.\\n\\nThe differences between this and Avengers battle of New York is there are scenes in New York that show a conscious effort to minimize civilian deaths and evacuate. This goes at least part of the way to explain why people are more receptive to the Avengers. There is no effort in Man of Steel to show Superman actually caring about the city he's destroying. No effort to move the fight elsewhere with no civilians or any regard for their lives. And yet, the narrative wants you believe that these people are traditional heroes as you, the public, knows them. This is especially obvious when you look at BvS. In the narrative, Bruce hates Superman's guts, talked to him for five minutes and then he died but their 'relationship' reads as one of at least a few years. The film assumes you know they're friends and so the narrative requires them to be friends, even if it doesn't make sense.\\n\\nFeel free to disagree. FYI; I don't like the Reeves Superman at all, but Superman is one of my favorite superheroes. Unpopular opinion: Man of Steel, with absolutely nothing else changed, would be a lot better if it was a gritty anime.\",\n",
